>## Activities and Tests {#concept_38D25CB81E8E4926A0ABC34042766DC3}An activity determines the experiences a site visitor might encounter. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_activitiestests.xml 
</draft-comment>[!DNL  Target] lets you test different experiences to determine which will be most successful. An activity compares two or more [ experiences ](c_getting_started.md#concept_B91F0F36E9F24AA58A3C6BC0A02871E8) against the success metrics you specify so you can choose the experience that is most likely to provide the results you want. 

For example, you might design an activity that tests two different landing pages, one that highlights information about women's summer shoes, and one that highlights more general summer apparel. The activity determines the conditions that control when each of these landing pages appears, and the metrics that determine which page is more successful. The activity is configured to start and end when specific conditions are met, such as between specific dates, or to start when the activity is approved and to end when it is deactivated. 

When designing an activity, you should plan carefully. Determine when the activity will start and how long it will last. Then, list your offers and assign a target audience to each one. 

This video explains the activity types available in [!DNL  Target Standard/Premium].

>## Locations {#concept_85E01D9DD0B64BD3A138C2D3DB83BD57}Primarily, a location is a page on your website. It could also refer to a place in a mobile app, an email, or any other place where you run an optimization. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_mboxes.xml 
</draft-comment>A location is the page or area on the page where an * [ offer ](c_getting_started.md#concept_40CA4EEBF72C430395ADB96C3A3D7DF4)* is displayed. An offer is the actual content that is displayed in the mbox. When a particular offer displays is controlled by an * [ experience ](c_getting_started.md#concept_B91F0F36E9F24AA58A3C6BC0A02871E8)*. 

Locations are essential to activities and experiences. You decide whether any location can do one, both, or none of the following: 


* Display and swap content for visitors.
* Log visitor behavior.


In [!DNL  Target Standard], a location can be any element on a page, as long as the page contains a single line of code that enables [!DNL  Target] in the ` &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;` section of each page you want to track. This line of code calls the JavaScript libraries needed to collect information and deliver targeted experiences to your visitors. 

See [ Implement Target ](c_target-implement.md#concept_60B748DE4293488F917E8F1FA4C7E9EB) for more information about the differences between location implementation in [!DNL  Target Standard] and the mbox implementation in [!DNL  Target Classic]. 

Locations are combined with [ audiences ](c_getting_started.md#concept_7CC998E8AC9C44F2926435D171361774) to provide an almost endless number of options for targeting information to your customers. For example, if a visitor has never been to the site before, you might display a discount coupon for new customers. Likewise, the page might be changed to display offers that are more optimized to returning customers. 

You can also use locations to track a visitor's progress through your Web site, or to track whether the visitor completes a specific success metric, such as adding an item to the shopping cart or completing a purchase. 
>## Experiences and Page Designs {#concept_B91F0F36E9F24AA58A3C6BC0A02871E8}An experience, sometimes called a recipe, defines the content that displays on your page, as well as other page elements, such as links. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_experience.xml 
</draft-comment>An experience determines which [ offer ](c_getting_started.md#concept_40CA4EEBF72C430395ADB96C3A3D7DF4) displays in a certain location when specific targeting conditions are met. For example, the experience determines that, when a return visitor visits your site, an offer for two-day shipping displays at the top of the page. The experience also determines that, when a first-time visitor views the page, a 10% discount appears in the same location. 

An experience consists of the offers, image assets, or other HTML elements (such as links) that appear on the page to help drive the visitor toward the result you desire. [!DNL  Target] combines locations, offers, and experiences to determine which content displays on your site during a specific test. 

An experience can also be a different page design. For example, one experience might have one set of links across the top of the page, where another experience has different links or the same links arranged in a different order. You might want to test whether one image provides more lift than another, or whether an ad is more likely to be clicked near the top of your page or in a different location. 

[!DNL  Target] optimizes experiences for each of your visitors across your digital touchpoints and to test different experiences to determine which will be most successful. By carefully planned targeting of experiences, you can make sure that your site visitors see the most relevant offers in the right locations on your page, improving your chances of a successful visit. 
>## Offers {#concept_40CA4EEBF72C430395ADB96C3A3D7DF4}An offer is the content displayed on your webpages during campaigns or activities. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_offers.xml 
</draft-comment>When you test your webpages, you measure the success of each experience with different offers in your locations. 

An offer can contain different types of content, including: 


* Image
* Text
* HTML
* Link
* Button


For example, a webpage might display either of two offers, depending on whether the visitor has been to your site before. 

An * [ experience ](c_getting_started.md#concept_B91F0F36E9F24AA58A3C6BC0A02871E8)* determines which content displays when particular conditions are met. 
>## Audiences {#concept_7CC998E8AC9C44F2926435D171361774}Optimize your targeted content to activity entrants who meet specific criteria. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_about_segments.xml 
</draft-comment>Audiences define the target for your activity and are used anywhere where targeting is available. 

This video explains how to use audiences in [!DNL  Target Standard/Premium].

[!DNL  Target] audiences are a defined set of visitor criteria. Offers can be targeted to specific audiences (or segments). Only visitors who belong to that audience see the experience that is targeted to them. 



For example, you might target an activity to an audience made up of visitors who use a particular browser or operating system. 

Or, your campaign might be targeted at visitors from one geographical region, or people who access your page from a certain search engine. 

In [!DNL  Target Classic], you can target a mobile device that meets certain criteria, such as a certain device maker or a specific screen size. So, for example, you might link to either your iPad or Android app. 

Audiences can be saved for reuse in multiple activities, or they can be created for a specific campaign.

>## How Adobe Target Works {#concept_459AB4DEE7364A9290C2FD405DC29584}Adobe Target integrates with websites by means of a JavaScript library. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_how_target_works.xml 
</draft-comment>[!DNL  Target Standard] updates and supplements the [!DNL  mbox.js] with a reference to a new [!DNL  target.js] file. The [!DNL  target.js] file is hosted by Adobe. [!DNL  Target.js] makes it possible to edit content on any page using the Visual Experience Composer, even if the page does not contain predefined mboxes. You must also reference this file on every page on your site. For example, you might add it to your global header. 

Each time a visitor requests a page that has been optimized for Target, a request is sent to the targeting system to determine what content to serve to a visitor. This process occurs in real-time—every time a page is loaded, a request for the content is made and fulfilled by the system. The content is governed by the rules of marketer-controlled activities and experiences and is targeted to the individual site visitor. Content is served that each site visitor is most likely to respond to, interact with, and ultimately purchase, to maximize response rates, acquisition rates, and revenue. 

The content that displays in a basic A/B test is randomly chosen from the assets you assign to the activity, according to the percentages you choose for each experience. As a result of this random splitting of traffic, it can take a lot of initial traffic before the percentages even out. For example, if you create two experiences, the starting experience is chosen randomly. If there is little traffic, it's possible that the percentage of visitors can be skewed toward one experience. As traffic increases, the percentages should become more equal. 

You can specify percentage targets for each experience. In this case, a random number is generated and that number is used to choose the experience to display. The resulting percentages might not exactly match the specified targets, but more traffic means that the experiences should be split closer to the target goals. 


1. A customer requests a page from your server and it displays in the browser.
1. A first party cookie is set in the customer's browser to store customer behavior.
1. The page calls the targeting system.
1. Content displays based on the rules of your campaign.


In Target Standard, each element on the page is part of a single experience for the entire page. Each experience includes multiple elements on the page. A page is optimized with a single line of code in the ` &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;` of each page you want to track. 

In Target Classic, a single page might contain multiple optimized content areas, called *mboxes*. An mbox is a ` div` tag that wraps around existing content on a Web page. The ` div` tag is followed by a single line of JavaScript to create the mbox instance. An mbox can encompass a single element, multiple elements, or an entire page. A single campaign (A/B, multivariate, or targeting) can use multiple mboxes to control multiple elements across multiple pages. Each mbox is uniquely named, and is immediately available for testing or targeting. In addition, an mbox that is used to serve content for one campaign can also be used to track conversions or log visitor behavior for another. You could use a multi-page campaigns to create a funnel analysis and track a number of different conversions based on their KPIs or specific business criteria. 
>## The Edge Network {#concept_0AE2ED8E9DE64288A8B30FCBF1040934}“Edge” is a geographically distributed serving architecture that ensures optimum response times for end-users requesting content, regardless of where they are located around the globe. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_edge_network.xml 
</draft-comment>To improve response times, Edge environments house only activity logic and cached profile and offer information. Activity and content databases, [!DNL  Analytics] data, APIs, and marketer user interfaces are housed in Adobe’s central data environments. Updates are then sent to the Edge nodes. The central environments and Edge nodes are automatically synched to continually update cached activity data. 1:1 modeling is also stored at each edge, so those more complex requests can also stay on the Edge. 

Each Edge node has all the information required to respond to the user's content request, and track analytics data on that request. User requests are routed to the nearest Edge node. 

![](../graphics/edge network.png) 

Core Edge site locations contain both a data collection center and a data processing center. Edge site locations contain only a data collection center. Each report suite is assigned to a specific data processing center. 

Adobe currently has data centers on several continents, including multiple regional locations across North America, Europe, and Asia. 

Rather than respond to all targeting requests from a single location, requests from the Edge environment closest to the point of request mitigate the impact of network/Internet travel time. 

The network also serves as a fail-over mechanism. If one edge node is not functioning, the request is redirected to the next nearest node, to ensure that the user is not served default content (a typical backup response when a request cannot be completed). 
>## Protected User Experience {#concept_40A5E781D90A41E4955F80EA9E5F8F96}Adobe ensures that the availability and performance of the targeting infrastructure is as reliable as possible. However, a communication breakdown between an end-user’s browser and Adobe’s servers can cause an interruption in content delivery. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_protected_user_experience.xml 
</draft-comment>To safeguard against service interruptions and connectivity issues, all locations are set up to include default content (defined by the client), which is surfaced if the user’s browser cannot connect to [!DNL  Target]. 

No changes are made to the page if the user’s browser cannot connect within a defined timeout period (by default,15 seconds). If this timeout threshold is reached, a setting is changed in the cookie so the user sees default content for all other locations immediately. This state lasts for a half hour, after which the user’s browser again attempts to contact Adobe’s servers for content requests. 

Adobe protects the user experience by optimizing and safeguarding performance. 


* Adobe ensures performance benchmarks based on industry standards, which are guaranteed by the Adobe Service Level Agreement.
* The Edge Network ensures timely data delivery.
* Adobe employs a multi-tiered approach to securing its applications to provide the highest level of availability and reliability for customers.

>## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Friendly Testing {#concept_C0C865663CAB4251B66A1F250FD25E6A}<keyword>
  Adobe Target 
</keyword> aligns with search engine guidelines for testing. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  ov/c_effect_on_seo.xml 
</draft-comment>Google encourages user testing and has stated in its documentation that A/B and multivariate testing will not harm organic search engine rankings as long as a few simple guidelines are followed. 

For more information, see the following Google resources: 


* [ Website testing and Google Search ](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2012/08/website-testing-google-search.html)
* [ Experiments and Cloaking ](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2576845?hl=en&ref_topic=1745207)


Guidelines were presented in a [ Google Webmaster Central Blog ](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2012/08/website-testing-google-search.html) post. Although the post dates back to 2012, it remains Google's most recent statement on the matter and the guidelines remain relevant. 

* ** No cloaking** - Cloaking is showing one set of content to your users and a different set of content to search engine bots by specifically identifying them and purposely feeding them different content. 

  Target, as a platform, has been configured to treat search engine bots the same as any user. This means that the bots might get included in tests you are running, if they are randomly selected, and "see" the test variations. 

* ** Use rel="canonical"** - Sometimes an A/B test needs to be set up using different URLs for the variations. In these instances, all variations should contain a ` rel="canonical"` tag that references the original (control) URL. For instance, if Adobe were testing its home page using different URLs for each variation, the following canonical tag for the home page would go in the ` &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;` tag for each of the variations: 

  ` &amp;lt;link rel="canonical" href="http://www.adobe.com" /&amp;gt;` 

* ** Use 302 (temporary) redirects** - In the instances where separate URLs are used for the variation pages in a test, Google recommends using a 302 redirect to direct traffic into the test variations. This tells the search engines that the redirect is temporary and will only be active as long as the test is running. 

  A 302 redirect is a server-side redirect, and Target, along with most optimization providers, uses client-side capabilities. Therefore, this is an area where Target is not fully compliant with Google's recommendations. This, however, impacts only a small fraction of tests. The standard approach for running tests through Target calls for changing content within a single URL, so no redirects are necessary. There are instances when clients need to use multiple URLs to represent their test variations. In these instances, Target uses the JavaScript ` window.location` command to direct users to test variations, which does not explicitly signify whether the redirect is a 301 or 302. 

  Although we continue to look for viable solutions to completely align with search engine guidelines, for those clients that must use separate URLs for testing, we are confident that proper implementation of the canonical tags mentioned above mitigates the risk associated with this approach. 

* ** Run experiments only as long as necessary** - We believe "as long as necessary" to be as long as it takes to reach statistical significance. Target [ provides best practices ](http://adobe-target.com/testcalculator.html) to determine when your test has reached this point. We recommend that you incorporate the hardcoded implementation of winning tests into your testing workflow and allot the appropriate resources. Using the Target platform to "publish" winning tests is not recommended as a permanent solution, but as long as the winning test is published for 100% of users 100% of the time, this approach can be used while the process of hardcoding the winning test is completed. 

  It's important to consider what your test has changed as well. Simply updating the color of buttons or other minor non-text-based items on the page will not have any influence over your organic rankings. Changes to text should be hardcoded, however. 

  It's also important to consider the accessibility of the page you're testing. If the page is not accessible to the search engines and was never designed to rank in organic search in the first place, such as a dedicated landing page for an email campaign, then none of the considerations above apply. 

Googles states that following these guidelines "should result in your tests having little or no impact on your site in search results." 

In addition to these guidelines, Google also provides one more guideline in the documentation to their Content Experiments tool: 


* "Your variation pages should maintain the spirit of the content on your original pages. Those variations shouldn't change the meaning of or your user's general perception of that original content." 



Google states as an example that "if a site's original page is loaded with keywords that don't relate to the combinations being shown to users, we may remove that site from our index." 

We feel that it would be difficult to unintentionally change the meaning of the original content within test variations, but we do recommend being aware of the keyword themes on a page and maintaining those themes. Changes to page content, especially adding or deleting relevant keywords, can result in ranking changes for the URL in organic search. We recommend that you engage with your SEO partner as part of your testing protocol.
