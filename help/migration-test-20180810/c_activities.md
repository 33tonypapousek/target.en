## Activities {#concept_D317A95A1AB54674BA7AB65C7985BA03}Activities let you test page designs and target content to specific audiences.All activity types other than [!UICONTROL  Automated Personalization] give you the choice to use either [!DNL  Target] or [!DNL  Adobe Analytics] as the data source. [!DNL  Automated Personalization] always uses Target data. 


>[!NOTE]

## Sorting and Filtering the Activities List {#section_41DAD479FFF740E2BB67BF4825955670}

By default, the list is sorted by the date the activity was last modified, with the most recent on top. However, there are several filtering options to help you customize the list to show the activities you want to see. 

**Search** 

Use the search field to search for activities that match your search criteria. 

![](../graphics/activities_search.png) 

The search field includes a drop-down menu to help you narrow your search by specifying one of the following search filters: 


* Activity Name
* URL
* Source


**Activity List Filters** 

You can determine which activities appear in your Activities list by selecting list filters. 

![](../graphics/activities_filters.png) 

You can filter by the following options. In each category, if nothing is selected, the default is All.

## Limitations {#section_049D4684403A4E07B998067EB8E9BE56}

Each Target activity has the following content limitations:

<table id="table_2BC0CCAEA2E24A298298E8456BE92642"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Item </th>

 </thead>
 <tbody>

   <td colname="col1"> <p>Unique selectors </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>300 </p> <p>if a selector is repeated in a different experience, it is counted once. However, if it is repeated in the same experience, it is counted again. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Offers in each experience </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>350 </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Click track selectors in metrics </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>50 </p> </td>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Mboxes in metrics </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>50 </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Audiences and locations </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>50 </p> <p>Audiences and locations (mbox) combination should not be more than 50. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

If you exceed any of these limits, the activity cannot be saved. 

Increasing the numbers of these items in your activity also increases the length of time it takes to synchronize the activity across Target. 

For additional limits of the Visual Experience Composer, see [ Visual Experience Composer Limitations ](vec-best-pracitces-and-troubleshooting.md#section_F33C2EA27F2E417AA036BC199DD6C721). 

## Attributes Imported into Target for Activities Updated Outside of Target {#section_802B0D174E6A44E1A96F404CA81AAE44}

If activities created in [!DNL  Target] are updated from outside of [!DNL  Target] (for example, via Adobe I/O), the following activity attributes are imported back into [!DNL  Target]: 

` thirdpartyId` 

` startDate` 

` endDate` 

` status` 

` priority` 

` marketingCloudMetadata(remoteModifiedBy)` 

This import job will run when the activities page is opened, with a maximum delay of ten minutes. (KB-1526)

## Target Standard/Premium Visual Experience Composer Only or Form-Based Composer Using Global mbox Only {#section_4A0A317DFED345649B58B0CB5B410C8B}

If your company uses Target Standard/Premium and the Visual Experience Composer exclusively, then content from multiple activities can be returned for the same call. Activities are delivered using the following decision flow: 


1. The Target server call comes to Target with information about the URL. 

1. Target pulls every activity running on that URL. 

1. Target attempts to match the visitor into activities. 

   If the visitor is already in an A/B test or Multivariate Test, they will match into that test until they convert. If they were previously in an experience targeting activity, they must match into it again. If they meet the audience rules, then the visitor falls into those activities and into specific experiences. ( [ How experience matching works ](c_target_rulebased.md#concept_014AB6795D2D4B6EB5E45A226A4FF7E9).) 

1. Content for all the activities and experiences the visitor matches is returned to the page. 

1. If the content for each activity references different [ CSS selectors ](c_experiences.md#concept_4EB7663E255F439B8D24079D23479337), then all content is displayed. 

   If there is an overlap or a duplicated CSS selector, then the activity content with the highest priority is displayed. The results from all activities that run on the page are counted and reflected in the reports. 


   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Target returns the content for all activities on the page, beginning with the lowest-priority content, which is then overwritten by each activity, from lowest to highest priority. In most cases, this results in the highest priority content being displayed. However, if a lower-priority activity alters the structure of the DOM for the page, it is possible that the higher-priority activity will not recognize the page structure, so the lower-priority content will be displayed. The results from all activities that run on the page are counted and reflected in the reports.


1. If multiple activities share the same priority level, then there are two tiebreakers: 


    * If only one activity has audience targeting, that activity is displayed. 

    * If all or none have targeting, then the activity that was approved first is displayed. 





## Target Standard/Premium Form-Based Composer and Target Standard/Premium Visual Experience Composer {#section_4620253E1CE942DD830724C7822B175F}


>[!NOTE]
>
>This information also applies to any campaigns running that were created in Target Classic.



If your company uses the form-based composer in Target Standard/Premium and the Target Standard/Premium Visual Experience Composer, then content from multiple Visual Experience Composer activities can deliver, but only one activity from the form-based workflow. Activity delivery is determined using the following decision flow: 


1. Target server call comes to Target with information about the mbox and URL. 

1. Target Classic and Standard pull every activity running in that mbox. 

1. Target attempts to match the visitor into activities. 

   If the visitor is already in an A/B test or Multivariate Test, they will match into that test until they convert. If they were previously in an experience targeting activity, they must match into it again. If they meet the audience rules, then the visitor falls into those activities and into specific experiences. ( [ Information about how experience matching works ](c_target_rulebased.md#concept_014AB6795D2D4B6EB5E45A226A4FF7E9).) 

1. If a form-based activity is the highest priority, then that activity content is returned along with all matching activity content from Visual Experience Composer activities. 

1. If a Visual Experience Composer activity is the highest priority, then content from all matching visual experience composer activities is returned, but no Target Classic or form-based activity content is returned. 

   The results from all activities that run on the page are counted and reflected in the reports. 



**Example** 

If you have two activities, one targeting the branded search keyword Nike and the second targeting the non-branded keyword sneakers, the priorities of both activities are checked. If the Nike activity has a higher priority, that content is displayed. If the sneakers activity has the higher priority, its content is displayed. 

If both targeted activities have the same priority, the activity that was most recently viewed is displayed. If the visitor is new to the page, the activity that was activated most recently is displayed. 

## Target Standard/Premium Form-Based Composer with Non-Global Mboxes {#section_C3F5F09B0B2D4EF795C5929D5C426A8C}


>[!NOTE]
>
>This information also applies to any campaigns running that were created in Target Classic.



If your company uses mboxes other than the global mbox in the form-based composer, content from only one activity can be returned per call. Activity delivery is determined using the following decision flow: 


1. The Target server call comes to Target with information about the mbox and URL. 

1. Target pulls every activity running in that mbox. 

1. Target attempts to match the visitor into the highest priority activity. 

   If the visitor is already in an A/B test or Multivariate Test, they will match into that test until they convert. If they were previously in an experience targeting activity, they must match into it again. If they meet the audience rules, then the visitor falls into those activities and into specific experiences. ( [ Information about how experience matching works ](c_target_rulebased.md#concept_014AB6795D2D4B6EB5E45A226A4FF7E9).) 

1. If multiple activities share the same priority level, then there are two tiebreakers: 


    * If only one activity has audience targeting, that activity is displayed. 

    * If all or none have targeting, then the activity that was approved first is displayed. 





## Examples {#section_F6A788AAC3884A2FA03E47F0557A1213}


>[!NOTE]
>
>Depending on your settings, the priority values vary. You can use the legacy settings of Low, Medium, or High, or you can enable fine-grained priorities from 0 to 999. For more information, see[ Activity Settings ](c_activities.md#task_C6B2FF8374724933BE79A83549B9CD02). 



**Two Target Classic campaigns use non-global mboxes ** 


* Campaign 1: homePageHero, offer1, priority high 

* Campaign 2: homePageHero, offer2, priority low 



Response: offer1 

**Two activities use only offers created in the Visual Experience Composer for different selectors** 


* Activity 1: target-global-mbox, selector1, visualExpCompOffer1, priority low 

* Activity 2: target-global-mbox, selector2, visualExpCompOffer2, priority high 



Response: visualExpCompOffer1, visualExpCompOffer2 

**Two activities use only offers created in the Visual Experience Composer for same selector** 


* Activity 1: target-global-mbox, selector1, visualExpCompOffer1, priority low 

* Activity 2: target-global-mbox, selector1, visualExpCompOffer2, priority high 



Response: visualExpCompOffer1, visualExpCompOffer2 


>[!NOTE]
>
>This is the same response as in the second use case above because Target Classic does not handle selector collisions. Target Standard catches such behavior and other use cases when selectors might collide both in DOM and visually (usually done at experience editor level or in campaign simulation mode).



**Two activities use offers created in the Visual Experience Composer and two Target Classic campaigns** 


* Activity 1: target-global-mbox, selector1, visualExpCompOffer1, medium high 

* Activity 2: target-global-mbox, selector2, visualExpCompOffer2, priority low 

* Campaign 1: target-global-mbox, offer1, priority high 

* Campaign 2: target-global-mbox, offer2, priority low 



Response: offer1, visualExpCompOffer2, visualExpCompOffer1 


>[!NOTE]
>
>The order of combined responses is that classic content comes first (only one classic response will be serviced as in use case 1) and then Visual Experience Composer offer responses that are ordered by inverted priority.

>## Activity QA {#concept_9329EF33DE7D41CA9815C8115DBC4E40}Use QA URLs to perform easy end-to-end activity QA with preview links that never change, optional audience targeting, and QA reporting that stays segmented from live activity data.

## Overview {#section_11B761A522A14E61978275772210A4C2}

Activity QA lets you fully test your Target activities prior to launching them live. The Activity QA functionality includes: 


* Links to share with team members that never change or require regeneration, regardless of updates made to the experiences or activities 

* Audience conditions optionally respected so marketers can test targeting criteria or ignore targeting criteria to QA the appearance of experiences without having to meet the audience conditions 

* QA reporting is captured so that marketers can confirm that metrics are incrementing as expected and the QA report data is kept separate from production reporting (for non-A4T reporting) 

* The ability to preview an experience in isolation or in conjunction with other live activities satisfying the delivery criteria (Page/mbox/audience). 

* The ability to QA the entire "user journey." You can access your site once with the QA link and then browse the entire site while in Activity QA. You remain in Activity QA until you end the session or until you use the [ QA Target bookmarklet ](c_activities.md#concept_A8A3551A4B5342079AFEED5ECF93E879) to force yourself out of Activity QA. This feature is particularly useful if you have an activity spanning multiple web pages. 



## Accessing and Sharing a QA URL {#section_1C59BAA247B247BDB125D1BE8EAD4547}


1. From an activity's [!UICONTROL  Overview] page (all types except Automated Personalization), click the ** [!UICONTROL  Activity QA] ** link. 

   ![](../graphics/qa link.png) 

1. Configure the following settings: 

   ![](../graphics/qa link config.png) 


    * **Match Audience Rules to See Experiences: **Sometimes you want to confirm that your audience matching works. Other times you just want to check the look and feel of the activity. If this setting is toggled to the "on" position, testers must meet targeting requirements to qualify to see the experiences. For Experience Targeting (XT) activities, a single activity URL is provided. The experience you see is determined by you qualifying for one of the targeting rules. 

      If this setting is toggled to the "off" position, clicking the links show you the experiences regardless of whether you qualify or not. When performing QA, you can switch back and forth between requiring or not requiring that audience targeting is respected. 

    * **Show Default Content for All Other Activities: **If this option is toggled to the "on" position, default content is shown for all other activities (for example, the preview will be shown in isolation without considering all other live activities on the same page/mbox. 

      If this setting is toggled to "off," consider the following: 

    
        * If there are collisions between the activity you are testing and other live activities, [ normal priority rules ](c_activities.md#concept_1780C11FEA57440499F0047DD6900E0F) apply. Because of this, it is possible you won't see the activity you are intending to QA. 

        * Metrics increment for the viewed activities, but only in the QA reporting environment. 





1. Click ** [!UICONTROL  Done] ** to save your changes. 

1. Share the Activity Link URLs with members of your organization for testing. 

   Activity Links never expire and you do not need to resend links if someone makes changes to an activity or experience. However, if you apply a different audience from the Audience Library, rather than simply editing the activity, a new link is generated that you'll need to re-share. 

   Each Activity Link URL (for Exp A, Exp B, etc.) lets you start the user journey from the corresponding experience. You can click the URL generated for an experience and then proceed with normal site browsing to see experiences on multiple pages (if multiple pages exist). Only one URL is generated per experience, even if the experience spans multiple pages (template testing or multi-page testing). You can navigate the site to see the other pages because the Activity QA is sticky. 

1. To see reports generated from Activity Link URLs, click the activity's ** [!UICONTROL  Reports] ** page, click the ** [!UICONTROL  Settings] ** icon (  ![](graphics/icon_gear.png) ), then select ** [!UICONTROL  QA Mode] ** from the ** [!UICONTROL  Environment] ** drop-down list. 



## Considerations {#section_B256EDD7BFEC4A6DA72A8A6ABD196D78}


* The [!UICONTROL  Activity QA] link displays on the [!UICONTROL  Overview] page of all activity types except for Automated Personalization (AP). You can use [ Preview links ](t_automated_personalization.md#task_586C6655A6FD4AF08F5678FC3F481EFC) for AP activities. 

* Activity QA URLs are available with activities with Analytics as the reporting source (A4T). Hits generated while performing QA using Activity QA will flow to the same report suite where the activity's data will flow even after the activity goes live. 

* Activity QA does not display content for archived activities or activities that are past its end date. 

* Activities imported into Target Standard/Premium (from Target Classic, for example) do not support QA URLs. 

* In Auto-Allocate, Auto-Target, and Recommendations activities, the model will not be affected by the visits captured in Activity QA. 

* Because Activity QA is sticky, after you browse a website in Activity QA, your Target session must expire or you need to have Target release you from Activity QA before you can view your site like a typical visitor. Use the [ Target QA bookmarklet ](c_activities.md#concept_A8A3551A4B5342079AFEED5ECF93E879) to force yourself out of Activity QA. 

  You can also manually force yourself out by loading a page on your site with the ` at_preview_token` parameter with an empty value (for example, ` http://www.mysite.com/?at_preview_token=`). 

* If you specified "URL is" while creating the activity ( [ refinements in the Form-based Composer ](t_form_experience_composer.md#task_FAC842A6535045B68B4C1AD3E657E56E) or [ page delivery options in the Visual Experience Composer) ](c_experiences.md#reference_3BD1BEEAFA584A749ED2D08F14732E81), the QA URL will not work because Activity QA appends URL parameters. To solve this issue, click the QA URL to go to your site, remove the appended parameters from the URL, then load the new URL. 

* 3rd-party cookies must be enabled in Safari browsers for Activity QA to work properly. 

* If an activity uses multiple experience audiences (for example, a UK and US site that are included in the same activity), QA links aren’t generated for the four combinations (Experience A/ US Site, Experience A/ UK Site, Experience B/ US Site, Experience B/ UK Site). Only two QA links (Experience A and Experience B) are created and users must qualify for the appropriate audience to see the page. A UK QA person couldn’t see the US site. 


>## Activity QA Bookmarklet {#concept_A8A3551A4B5342079AFEED5ECF93E879}Information to help you use the Target QA bookmarklet to force Target to release you from QA mode. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  target/c_activity-qa-bookmark.xml 
</draft-comment>Because [ QA mode ](c_activities.md#concept_9329EF33DE7D41CA9815C8115DBC4E40) is sticky, after you browse a website in QA mode, your Target session must expire or you need to have Target release you from QA mode before you can view your site like a typical visitor. Use the QA Target bookmarklet to force yourself out of QA mode. 

To use the Target QA bookmarklet, drag the following bookmarklet to your browser's Bookmarks Toolbar: 

**Bookmarklet: ** [ Release Adobe Target Activity QA ](javascript:(function () {var parts = window.location.href.split('at_preview_token',2); if (parts.length > 1) {window.location.href = parts[0].concat('at_preview_token=');} })();) 

The bookmarklet should then appear on the toolbar for re-use. 

You can also manually force yourself out of QA mode by loading a page on your site with the ` at_preview_token` parameter with an empty value (for example, ` http://www.mysite.com/?at_preview_token=`).
