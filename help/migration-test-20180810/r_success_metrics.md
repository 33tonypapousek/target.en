>In keeping with the [!DNL  Target Standard] goal of simplifying test creation, the application takes care of some of the configuration that was done manually in [!DNL  Target Classic]. For example, success metrics are pre-configured with the optimal options. 

>By default, conversion events are set to "count once and keep the entrant in the activity" in [!DNL  Target Standard]. Conversions are counted only once, no repeat conversions are counted, and the visitor always sees the test content. 

>Revenue metrics that are set to "Increment count and keep the user in the activity" log order details only for the first order made by the same visitor. All subsequent orders increase conversion count, but will not add revenue to RPV/AOV/Sales, and will not be included in the Order Details report. 

>The following success metrics are available:

>You can also create custom success metrics. 

>After selecting the success metric, select the action taken by a visitor to achieve the goal. For example, choose a Conversion metric, set it to be counted once per visitor, then set whether success is achieved when a visitor views a certain page (or set of pages), views a specific mbox, or clicks a specific link. 

>If enabled, the Estimated Value of one conversion field (not available for the Page Score metrics) provides a value for your goal, but not for other metrics. This value enables [!DNL  Target] to calculate an estimated lift in revenue. This field is optional; however, incremental revenue for any non-revenue metric cannot be calculated without it. For all revenue metrics (Revenue per Visitor, Average Order Value, Total Sales, and Orders), the estimate uses Revenue per Visitor. The data type is currency. See [ Estimating Lift in Revenue ](c_estimating_lift_in_revenue.md#concept_32F875D8F91349CE86AF391F65BEAEEE) for more information. 

>The success metrics you choose for your activity are available in the report settings when you view a report for the activity. 

>Some metrics, such as Custom Scoring and Revenue Per Visitor, require a customized implementation that passes in information such as order totals and order IDs. 

## Advanced Settings {#section_7CE95A2FA8F5438E936C365A6D43BC5B}

Use the advanced settings to manage how you measure success. Options include counting the metric per impression or once per visitor, and choosing whether to keep the user in the activity or removing them. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>If you use [!DNL  Adobe Analytics] as your reporting source, settings are managed by the [!DNL  Analytics] server. The advanced settings option will not be available. 



![](graphics/Menu_AdvancedSettings.png) 

You can also use the advanced settings to create dependent success metrics, incrementing one metric only if a visitor reaches another metric first. 

![](graphics/UI_dep_success_metric.png) 

For example, a test conversion might only be valid if a visitor clicks the offer, or reaches a particular page before converting. 

Dependent success metrics are supported in A/B testing, Automated Personalization, Experience Targeting, and Multivariate testing activities. Recommendations activities do not currently support dependent success metrics. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>Dependent success metrics will not convert in the following cases:




* If you create a circular dependency in which metric1 is dependent on metric2 and metric2 is dependent on metric1, neither metric can convert.
* Automated Personalization activities release users and restart the activity when conversion metrics are reached, so any metric dependent on the conversion metric will not convert.


Use the advanced settings to determine what happens after a user reaches the goal metric. The following table shows the available options.

>## Click Tracking {#concept_BC6753401F4048A980439C6AEAA907CC}Target enables you to track clicks on any element as a success metric.

## Setting Up Click Tracking {#section_5540C5A533114E57BAE022A600B02E72}


1. When setting your goals on the [!UICONTROL  Goals &amp;amp; Settings] page for your activity , select the ** [!UICONTROL  Conversion] ** success metric. 

1. For the action, select ** [!UICONTROL  Clicked an element] **, then click ** [!UICONTROL  Select elements] **. 

   Your page opens in the [!UICONTROL  Visual Experience Composer] (VEC). 

1. Select any elements that you want to track. 

   See the Considerations section below for tips on selecting elements. 

1. Click the check mark at the top of the screen to save your selections. 



When an activity entrant clicks a selected element, that click is counted as a conversion. 

## Considerations {#section_DD49EBA86CC5475E96BA87D2468FDB36}

There are several things to consider when selecting elements: 


* You can browse to a different page to track clicks on a page where you might not be changing content. This different page must be included in the activity using the [ multipage feature ](c_experiences.md#concept_277E096063E14813AC5D8EDFA1D2ED48) and [!DNL  at.js] or [!DNL  mbox.js] must be implemented on it. 

* If you select more than one element, if an entrant clicks on any one of the chosen elements, the click is counted. To count each item separately, set up individual success metrics for each element. 

* Make sure you select the level of element you want to track. For example, when specifying a button, make sure you select the link and not the button text. 

* Click events are sent to [!DNL  Target] on the same page as the click. 

* If the click-tracking metric is the Goal metric of an A4T activity, the visitor must click this element within 60 seconds of the page loading in order for the metric to track. 

* Click tracking does not work on elements that include escaped characters in their selectors, including the following: 



  |  Character  | Description  |
  |---|---|
  |  #  | Number sign or Hash  |
  |  :  | Colon  |
  |  .  | Period  |
  |  $  | Dollar sign  |
  |  [ ]  | Square brackets  |


* If you use [!DNL  at.js] click tracking and you also use Analytics AppMeasurement, [!DNL  at.js] click tracking cancels all other click event handlers. As a result, the AppMeasurement click handler never executes. 

[!DNL  at.js] has special handling for click tracking when the underlying element is an ` A` (link) tag or ` FORM` tag. 

  The following steps are executed by [!DNL  at.js] when the click tracking event is attached to an ` A` (link) tag or a ` FORM` tag: 

1. Invoke ` event.preventDefault()`. 

  2. Fire Target request. 

  3. On Target request success or error callback, execute default behavior: 
    * ` A` (link) tag: The default behavior is to navigate to the URL defined by HREF attribute. 

    * ` FORM` tag: The default behavior is to submit the form. 



  This default behavior might interfere with Analytics click tracking. If you are using Analytics, you should rely on Analytics for click tracking rather than Target. 


>## Capture Score {#concept_01D9429F07AC4698BFCADB1A973D3748}The Capture Score engagement metric calculates an aggregated score based on the value assigned to pages visited on the site, from the point the visitor first sees the campaign's first display mbox. 
<draft-comment otherprops="merge">
  target/c_capture-score.xml 
</draft-comment>The following example shows how score engagement is calculated in a campaign that tests two experiences, one with a cat image, and one with a dog image. 

![](../graphics/example_score.png) 

In this example, the first visitor experiences the cat experience. Assume that a global mbox passes in a page score based on the value of the page. If the marketer has captured page count engagement on a success metric associated with ` **any mbox**`, the visit score accumulates for any mbox request seen after the display mbox around the cat image. 

The first page adds 1 to the score, the second page 0.25, the third 0.10, and the fourth 0.10 for a total of 1.45. This could be interpreted as either currency or points. In a separate visit, a visitor experiences the Dog experience, and although the visitor views fewer pages, the score is 2.10, greater than the other visit, because the visitor viewed more valuable pages. 

You can take into account acquisition costs and affiliate link revenue by passing adboxes and redirectors, as depicted in the following page flow. Notice that, in this example, both mboxes on the article page pass a score, possibly representing a known CPM. 

![](../graphics/example_score2.png) 

**Assigning a Page Score** 

You can assign a value to any page on your site based on what the page is worth to you. For example, a cooking site might be able to sell ads for more money on their feature article pages than in their experience section. Thus, the feature articles are more valuable than the experience section. Page score allows you to develop an overall "value" of a visit, so the person who reads more feature articles gets more "points" than someone who just browses the experiences. 

There are two methods to assign a score to a page: 


* In the mbox code, create an mbox parameter called ` mboxPageValue`. Example: ` ('global_mbox', 'mboxPageValue=10');` 

  The specified value is added to the score every time the page with that mbox is viewed. If multiple mboxes on the page include score values, the score for the page is the total of all mbox values. ` mboxPageValue` is a reserved parameter used for passing values in an mbox to capture an engagement score. Positive and negative values can be passed. The sum is calculated at the end of each visitor's visit to calculate the total score for the visit. 

* Pass the ` ?mboxPageValue=n` parameter in the URL for the page. Example: ` http://www.mydomain.com?mboxPageValue=5` 

  Using this method, the specified value is added to the score for each mbox on the page. For example, if you pass the parameter ` ?mboxPageValue=10`and there are three mboxes on the page, the score for the page is 30. 




>[!NOTE] {class="- topic/note "}
>
>Mboxes located above the campaign's first display mbox will not be included in the score.



Best practice is to assign values in the mbox code. This allows you to be precise in the values you measure, depending on the content of each mbox. 


>[!NOTE] {class="- topic/note "}
>
>For easier maintenance, you can configure your site's page score value assignments in the [!DNL  at.js] or ` mbox.js` file with some conditional JavaScript logic. This eliminates the need to add more code to your pages. Contact your account consultant for assistance. 



You can combine the two methods, but this might result in a higher score than expected. For example, if you assign a value of 10 to each of three mboxes and no score to a fourth mbox, then pass the URL parameter ` ?mboxPageValue=5`, your page score will be 50, 30 for the three mboxes with assigned values, and then 5 for each of the four mboxes on the page. 

The counter starts with the first display mbox, not the entry mbox. For example, if you enter the campaign on the homepage which doesn't have a display mbox, then link to catalog page containing a display mbox, the counter begins when you move to the catalog page. 

You can also pass in negative values on certain pages that cost you money or are not good for a visitor to see. The negative values affect the overall score as well. This technique can be used on a page that visitors reach from an advertisement, so you know how much the CPC was. Or, for example, it can be used for a support or contact page, where you know that visitors might call or request assistance from this page.
