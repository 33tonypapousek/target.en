# Offers

When you test your webpages, you measure the success of each experience with different offers in your locations. 

An offer can contain different types of content, including: 


* Image
* Text
* HTML
* Link
* Button


For example, a webpage might display either of two offers, depending on whether the visitor has been to your site before. 

An *[ experience](c_experience.md#concept_B91F0F36E9F24AA58A3C6BC0A02871E8)* determines which content displays when particular conditions are met.
