# Audiences

Audiences define the target for your activity and are used anywhere where targeting is available. 

This video explains how to use audiences in [!DNL  Target Standard/Premium].

[!DNL  Target] audiences are a defined set of visitor criteria. Offers can be targeted to specific audiences (or segments). Only visitors who belong to that audience see the experience that is targeted to them. 



For example, you might target an activity to an audience made up of visitors who use a particular browser or operating system. 

Or, your campaign might be targeted at visitors from one geographical region, or people who access your page from a certain search engine. 

In [!DNL  Target Classic], you can target a mobile device that meets certain criteria, such as a certain device maker or a specific screen size. So, for example, you might link to either your iPad or Android app. 

Audiences can be saved for reuse in multiple activities, or they can be created for a specific campaign.
