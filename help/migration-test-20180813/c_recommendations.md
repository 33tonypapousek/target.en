>[!NOTE]

>If you currently have [!DNL  Recommendations Classic], see [ Recommendations Classic versus Recommendations Activities in Target Premium](c_recommendations/c_recommendations-classic-versus-recommendations-activities-target-premium.md#concept_A80223EF66634EA380580C2823A581C5) for more information about the two solutions. 



[!DNL  Recommendations] helps you optimize and customize real-time suggestions across channels, apps, pages, email messages, and other delivery options to increase engagement and conversion while reducing management effort. 

[!DNL  Recommendations] helps you: 


* Create sophisticated criteria (rules) to automate recommendations 

* Automatically display the recommendations by using a few JavaScript snippets 

* Test and optimize the recommendations criteria and designs that display the recommendations 

* Report on the results of your recommendations activities 



The following illustration shows recommendations on a web page:

A recommendation determines how a product is suggested to a customer, depending on that customer's activities on the site. For example: 



<table id="table_4753CB411DA247C08C8AC46B0D034879"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Desired Action </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Recommendation </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Encourage people who purchase a backpack to consider buying hiking shoes and trekking poles. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Create a recommendation that shows items that are often purchased together, using the "People who bought this also bought that" criteria. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Increase the time visitors spend on your media site by recommending media content similar to what they are watching. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Create a recommendation that suggests other videos, using the "People who viewed this viewed that" criteria. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Suggest that customers who viewed information about savings plans at your bank also read about IRA accounts. </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Show other products people purchased after viewing one product without showing the first product in the recommendations, using the "people who viewed this also bought" criteria. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
