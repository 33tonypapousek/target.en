# Set Metrics

For detailed information about success metrics, see [ Success Metrics ](r_success_metrics.md#reference_D011575C85DA48E989A244593D9B9924). 

>1. Specify the goal of the activity.
>1. Select a [ success metric ](r_success_metrics.md#reference_D011575C85DA48E989A244593D9B9924)

>       ![](/migration-test-20180813/assets/ab_metrics.png) 

>       The [!UICONTROL  Select Metrics] page lists the success metrics you can choose for your activity. The success metrics are divided into the following categories: 

>    
>    * Conversion
>    * Revenue
>    * Engagement


>       You can use any of the pre-built success metrics, or create a custom success metric. You can also mark a success metric as a primary metric. Reports and Experience Cloud cards default to show the primary metric, if one is set. 
>1. Specify the settings for your metrics.

>       The available settings depend on the success metric you are using. 

>       If enabled, the [!UICONTROL  Estimated Value of the Conversion]field (not available for the Page Score metrics) provides a value for your goal. This value enables Target to calculate an estimated lift in revenue. This field is optional; however, incremental revenue for any non-revenue metric cannot be calculated without it. The data type is currency. This field is progressively shown after the user indicates the action taken to satisfy the goal. See [ Estimating Lift in Revenue ](c_estimating_lift_in_revenue.md#concept_32F875D8F91349CE86AF391F65BEAEEE) for more information. 

>       The correct configuration of success metrics is critical for making sure you get the data you expect. 

>       For more information, see [ Success Metrics ](r_success_metrics.md#reference_D011575C85DA48E989A244593D9B9924).
