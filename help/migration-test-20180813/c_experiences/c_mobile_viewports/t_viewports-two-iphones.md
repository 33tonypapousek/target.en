# Use Case: Target Two iPhone Versions


>1. In Target Standard, click ** [!UICONTROL  Setup] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Preferences] **.

>1. In the Mobile Viewport Configuration section of the Preferences page, create mobile viewports for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus.

>       Use the following settings for each viewport: 



>       |  Name  | Width  | Height  | Operating System  |
>       |---|---|---|---|
>       |  iPhone 6  | 375  | 667  | iOS  |
>       |  iPhone 6 Plus  | 414  | 736  | iOS  |

>1. Create an activity with the experience you would like to Target.

>       Because the phone could be rotated to landscape, requiring both height and width to be greater than 320 simultaneously creates a condition that only the 6 and 6 Plus would be able to meet, when combined with the iPhone Device Model. 
>1. Click ** [!UICONTROL  Save] **.

>1. Continue setting up your activity as you normally would.
