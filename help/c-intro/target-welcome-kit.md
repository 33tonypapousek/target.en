# Adobe Target welcome kit

Welcome to Adobe Target. This Adobe Target welcome kit introduces

## Chapter 1: Introduction

If you’re like most businesses today, you’ve modernized your digital marketing channels. Now you’re looking for ways to distinguish your brand--to break away from the pack, and in doing so increase revenue, conversion rates, and other key business metrics. One way to do that is by optimizing and personalizing the digital experiences you deliver your customers by using what you know about them to get the most out of their interactions on your website, mobile site, mobile app, or any other brand touchpoint. You might even want to extend this optimization and personalization beyond your traditional digital touchpoints to touchpoints like kiosks, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, call center interactions, and voice assistants like Alexa. Brands that have used [!DNL Target] to test and personalize their digital experiences have realized incredible results.

For example:

* A major bank tested and streamlined a loan application form. Application starts tripled and application completes increased by more than 50 percent.
* A large B2B technology company personalized product pages with assets such as guides and white papers. Asset clicks increased by more than 25 percent.
* A major hotel company personalized its mobile app content. Conversion rates doubled compared to its mobile site, and the app drove over $1.5 billion in bookings.

Engaging with your customers this way requires a solution that can be used on just about any touchpoint using almost any source of data to understand them. [!DNL Adobe Target], part of [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], is that solution. [!DNL Target] gives you the optimization and personalization capabilities you need to deliver your customers the highly relevant and timely experiences that yield more revenue and higher conversion.

If you’re reviewing this welcome kit, you’ve already decided to build your optimization and personalization program on [!DNL Adobe Target]. We’re glad you did.

Now we want to make sure that you start using it the right way, right away.

To assist with that, we’ve created this welcome kit, with key information, tools, and resources to help you prepare for and launch your first [!DNL Target] activity. Long term, these contents also provide the foundation for building a successful optimization and personalization program.

## Chapter 2: Adobe Target at a glance

Before you get started using [!DNL Adobe Target], it might be helpful to get a high-level overview of the solution. In this chapter, get to know the solution’s key capabilities, brand touchpoints on which you can use it, implementation options, important user interface features and workflows, governance features, and its role in the overall [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud]. Unless noted as [!DNL Adobe Target Premium] features, the items described in this chapter are available with both [!DNL Adobe Target Premium] and [!DNL Adobe Target Standard]. For more information, see [Introduction to Target](/help/c-intro/intro.md).

### Capabilities and activities

Testing and personalization are the two broad types of capabilities that [!DNL Target] offers and that you can use when creating an “activity” in [!DNL Target]. You might see the term “testing” used interchangeably with “optimization,” and “personalization” used interchangeably with “targeting.”

In a testing activity, you compare one variation of a digital experience against one or more other variations to discover that one that causes the most visitors to take a desired action. [!DNL Target] offers the following testing capabilities: A/B testing, Multivariate testing (MVT), and Auto-Allocate.

With a personalization activity, you deliver a digital experience that is tailored to a specific group of visitors or to each individual visitor. [!DNL Target] offers these personalization capabilities: Experience Targeting, Auto-Target, Automated Personalization, and Recommendations.

For a more in-depth understanding of when and how to use each capability, see [Target activity types](/help/c-activities/target-activities-guide.md).

|Activity type|Details|
| --- | --- |
|Experience Targeting (XT)|Deliver content to a specific audience based on a set of user-defined rules and criteria. **[!UICONTROL Experience Targeting]** is valuable for targeting a specific experience or content to a particular audience when you understand that an audience is valuable and have a good sense of what experience resonates with them. [Learn more](/help/c-activities/t-experience-target/experience-target.md).|
|A/B Testing|Compare two or more variations of your experiences or offers on your website, or other digital customer touchpoint to see which variation most improves key business measures during a pre-specified test period. A/B tests are well-suited for large changes, such as new web page layouts, different approaches to site navigation, or drastically different treatments of individual elements of a digital experience like copy, images, and call-to-action buttons. [Learn more](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/test-ab.md).|
|Multivariate Testing (MVT)|Compare all possible combinations of variations of elements on your page or digital experience--for example of three different background images, two variations of copy, and two different button colors. MVT determines which combination performs the best for a specific audience and which elements most impact the results. [Learn more](/help/c-activities/c-multivariate-testing/multivariate-testing.md).|
|Auto-Allocate|Identify the best-performing experience among two or more experiences, and automatically re-allocate more traffic to the winner to increase conversions while the test continues to run and learn. Uses Artificial Intelligence powered by [!DNL Adobe Sensei]. [Learn more](/help/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md).|
|Auto-Target<br>(Premium)|Leverage Adobe Sensei AI in [!DNL Target] to determine and deliver the best experience of several to each visitor based on his or her individual customer profile and the behavior of previous visitors with similar profiles. Auto-Target enables personalization at scale.|
|Automated Personalization<br>(Premium)| Use advanced machine learning algorithms and automation powered by [!DNL Adobe Sensei] to review different combinations of images, copy, and other elements in an offer and deliver the best combination to each visitor based on which best achieves business goals, such as increased conversions or revenue per visitor. [Learn more](/help/c-activities/t-automated-personalization/automated-personalization.md).|
|Recommendations<br>(Premium)|Use Adobe Sensei AI to automatically suggest products or content that might interest your customers based on their previous activity and that of other customers. [Learn more](/help/c-recommendations/recommendations.md).|

### Channels

You can use [!DNL Target] to test and personalize digital experiences just about anywhere--traditional digital touchpoints like your web site, mobile site, and mobile app, but also on touchpoints like kiosks, email, IoT devices, gaming consoles, and even voice assistants like Alexa and Cortana. Many companies start using [!DNL Target] on their web site. However, recent research indicates that more people visit brands from their mobile devices. Optimizing your mobile channels is now essential. Ideally, you’ll connect the visitor’s experiences across all your touchpoints to deliver a seamless, consistent experience.

|Channel|Details|
| --- | --- |
|Website|[!DNL Target] can be used to run A/B Testing, Multivariate Testing, Experience Targeting, Auto-Allocate, Auto-Target, Automated Personalization, and Recommendations activities on pages of your multi-page, single page application (SPA), and mobile websites to improve visitor and customer engagement, increase conversions, and increase revenue.|
|Mobile Web|[!DNL Target] can be used to run all the same activity types that you run on your website on your mobile website pages to similarly improve visitor and customer engagement, increase conversions, and increase revenue.|
|Mobile App|[!DNL Target] can be used to test and personalize mobile app experiences based on user behavior and mobile context. [!DNL Target] lets you deliver interactions that engage and convert through iterative testing as well as Experience Targeting and AI-powered personalization. To use [!DNL Target] on your mobile app, you must use the Adobe Mobile Services SDK.|
|IoT/Everywhere|[!DNL Target] offers a server-side implementation so that you can use the same testing and personalization capabilities in activities that you use on your traditional website, mobile site, and mobile apps in emails and on touchpoints that lack a browser or don’t use JavaScript code. For example, so you could test and personalize kiosks, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, voice assistants, and other non-traditional touchpoints.|

### Implementations

Many of you might want to use [!DNL Target] to test and personalize on your many different digital touchpoints, including traditional web and mobile touchpoints, but also touchpoints that lack a browser or don’t use JavaScript code. In some cases, internal or external policy requires you to have additional levels of control and security. You might also have processes that need to run on a backend server for performance reasons. To meet this wide variety of uses, we give you the ability to implement [!DNL Target] in different ways: client-side, server-side, or a combination of the two.

|Implementation type|Details|
| --- | --- |
|Client-side|With this implementation of [!DNL Target], [!DNL Target] delivers the experiences associated with an activity directly to the client browser. The browser decides which experience to display and displays it. With client-side, you can use a WYSIWYG editor, the **[!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer]** (VEC), or a non-visual interface, the **[!UICONTROL Form-based Experience Composer]**, to create your test and personalization experiences. [Learn more](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/c-how-atjs-works/how-atjs-works.md).|
|Server-side| In this type of [!DNL Target] implementation, a client device makes a request for an experience through your server, your server sends that request to [!DNL Target], [!DNL Target] sends back the response to your server, and your server makes the decision on what experience to deliver to the client device for it to render. The experience does not need to display in a browser; it can display in an email or kiosk, via a voice assistant, or through some other non-visual experience or non-browser-based device. Because your server sits between the client and [!DNL Target], this type of implementation is also ideal if you need greater control and security or have complex backend processes that you want to run on your server. [Learn more](/help/c-implementing-target/c-api-and-sdk-overview/api-and-sdk-overview.md).|
|Hybrid implementation| In this implementation, you choose the implementation approach that works best for a given use case. For example, you might use a client-side implementation to A/B test an offer in a hero banner on the home page, but also use a server-side implementation to determine the internal search results to display on a client browser, experience to display on a smart car dashboard, or voice response to deliver from a voice assistant.|

### Activity elements

In [!DNL Target], you can create a personalization activity, an optimization activity, or an activity that optimizes your personalization approach. Each activity has key elements--the experiences or offers you’re testing or personalizing, the audiences or individuals to whom you’re delivering an experience, the metrics by which you measure the impact of the activity, and the reports that visually display that impact.

|Element type|Details|
| --- | --- |
|Experiences|An offer, image, text, button, video, combination of these various elements on a page, an entire web page, or a set of pages that perhaps form a purchase funnel or some other logical sequence of pages. It can also be the response of a voice assistant, a customer service script, or even a personalized flavor from a drink machine. You test or personalize experiences in [!DNL Target] activities. [Learn more](/help/c-experiences/experiences.md).|
|Offers|A block of content that might contain images, text, HTML, links, video, a call to action button, a voice assistant response, or any other type of content. An offer might be for a discount, free shipping, and so on. An offer can be displayed on a web page, but might also be experienced on any customer touchpoint, such as a voice assistant or gaming console. When you test an offer, you measure its success in comparison to other offers or no offer. [Learn more](/help/c-experiences/c-manage-content/manage-content.md). |
|Audiences| A group of people with the same characteristics, such as a new visitor, a returning visitor, or returning visitors from the Midwest. The Audience feature allows you to target different content and experiences to specific audiences to optimize your digital marketing by displaying the right messages to the right people at the right time. If a visitor is identified as part of a target audience, [!DNL Target] determines which experience to display, based on criteria defined during activity creation. [Learn more](/help/c-target/target.md). |
|Success metrics|Key business measures that enable you to determine the success of a given experience or offer in a [!DNL Target] activity. For example, you can determine if a new offer increases your revenue per visitor or adding an item to a shopping cart. Success metrics can be useful for discovering issues with registration, ordering, or purchase funnels, but also simply with visitor or customer engagement. [Learn more](/help/c-activities/r-success-metrics/success-metrics.md).|
|Reports|Information about the progress and results of your activities that help you make decisions based on your data. Report data can help you decide when to end a test, show you which experience of offer is the winner, and provide insights or learnings you need to determine next actions. [Learn more](/help/c-reports/reports.md).|

### Activity-creation tools

[!DNL Target] provides you with three main ways to set up your testing and personalization activities, the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC), the [!UICONTROL Form-based Experience Composer], and the [!UICONTROL Single Page Application (SPA) Visual Experience Composer]. Both guide you through the activity setup process in three-steps—defining the experiences, selecting or defining the audiences, and selecting the primary and secondary success metrics by which you’ll measure the results of your activity.

|Tool|Details|
| --- | --- |
|[!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC)|A WYSIWYG user interface that lets you easily create and test personalized experiences and offers in the site context. You can create experiences and offers for [!DNL Target] activities by dragging and dropping, swapping, and modifying the layout and content of a web page (or offer) or mobile web page. [Learn more](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/visual-experience-composer.md).|
|[!UICONTROL Form-based Experience Composer]|A non-visual experience and offer creation interface that’s useful in creating experiences for use in A/B tests, Experience Targeting, Automated Personalization, and Recommendations activities when the Visual Experience Composer is not available or practical for use. For example, you might use the form-based composer to create experiences and offers for delivery in emails, kiosks, and voice assistants. [Learn more](/help/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md).|
|[!UICONTROL Single Page Application (SPA) Visual Experience Composer]|The VEC for SPAs enables marketers to create tests and personalize content on SPAs in a do-it-yourself fashion without continuous development dependencies. The VEC can be used to create A/B Test and Experience Targeting (XT) activities on popular frameworks, such as React and Angular. [Learn more](/help/c-experiences/spa-visual-experience-composer.md).|

### Governance and control

To provide the right people the right roles and associated levels of access and permissions to [!DNL Target], we have an administrative console. For [!UICONTROL Target Premium] users, we offer more detailed governance and control
with [!UICONTROL Enterprise Permissions].

| --- | --- |
|[!UICONTROL Adobe Admin Console for Enterprise]|Add users to Adobe Target and assign permissions from the Adobe Admin Console. [Learn more](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md).|
|[!UICONTROL Enterprise Permission]s<br>(Premium)| A means of formal administering enterprise-wide user access to [!DNL Target]. Add users to [!DNL Target], assign permissions based on their roles, and create workspaces for teams based on different departments, global locations, channel, and other logical groupings. You can assign users the roles of Observer, Editor, Publisher, or Approver. [Learn more](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/property-channel.md).|

### Integrations

[!DNL Target] can integrate with many first-, second-, and third-party systems. These
integrations can be valuable for giving you access to visitor and customer data available from those systems for use in creating audiences for testing and for personalization. As part of [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], [!DNL Target] integrates tightly with [!DNL Experience Cloud] solutions and its Core Services.

|Integration|Details|

### Keep in mind

Consider the following ideas before we move on to the next chapter: "Develop your testing and personalization ideas."

#### Best practices for optimization

* **Good strategy**: What is our objective and hypothesis? Are they aligned? For example, we want to increase loan application submissions, so we hypothesize that reducing the number of fields in application form will do that.
* **Disciplined methodology** Are we starting to test in the right places? For example,you need locations that have enough traffic and that impact the metrics that matter    to the business.
* **Proper setup** Is our activity set up to achieve our objective? For example, if we are trying to increase loan application submissions, we should target people interested in loans and measure clicks of the “Submit” button.
* **Thorough analysis**: Did the test activity run to completion? What do the results say? Run your activity until it achieves between 95% and 99% statistical confidence. Document why you think the winning experience won and apply the learning elsewhere.
* **Iterative testing**: Are we building on the learnings of previous activities? If you find a winning tactic, try to improve on it or make changes that work with it to further improve your success metric.

#### Opinions can negatively affect your results

* Opinions that can negatively impact your effectiveness. Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HIPPO), attitudes, biases. For example, the CEO wants to reduce the size of the search box to make more room on each page. We should test to make sure that it doesn’t reduce the number of searches.
* Are you acting on opinions? I don’t like the way that test looks. The customer won’t like this experience at all. While intuition is useful, A/B testing has proven time and again that it’s not always spot on.
* Or do you have an optimization mindset? I’m excited to see which experience wins. Do we have enough options to test?

#### Assumptions can also negatively affect results

* Assumptions that can negatively impact your effectiveness. Herd mentality (this is how our competitors are doing it). For example, all our competitors use hero banners with rotating images, so we should, too.
* Assuming we know why something is or isn’t working. Assuming we don’t need to test something. For example, we always list hotel rooms in order of highest to lowest priced as the default.
* Are you acting on assumptions? We don’t need to test that, we’ve checked analytics. (Yes, but there may be more to the story than analytics reveals.)
* Or do you have an optimization mindset? We test everything.

## Chapter 3: Develop your testing and personalization ideas

For your first activity, you might test something super simple like changing the color or copy on a call to action button. Just to get your feet wet. Longer term, though, you’ll want to establish a formal, repeatable process for coming up with ideas for testing and personalization activities that helps mature your optimization and personalization program. The following six steps outline a proven process for doing just that, along with details about what to do at each step.

![Iterative Execution of Optimization and Personalization Strategy diagram](/help/c-intro/assets/six-steps.png)

### Step 1: Strategize

Identify opportunities for activities that align with business objectives. 

Do this by:

* Brainstorming potential [!DNL Target] activities based on site performance data, competitor analysis, and past test results.
* Developing ideas for activities for review, feedback, and sign-off.

For example, look for a page on your site with a high bounce rate, consider what might be causing the issue, and brainstorm ways to reduce bounce rate.

### Step 2: Prioritize

Rank and schedule activities based on business alignment, level of effort, and potential impact.

Do this by:

* Ranking potential activities based on multiple criteria to increase chances of success and align with business goals.
* Researching past test experience results to determine the potential of follow-up testing.
* Reviewing and sharing the prioritized testing roadmap with internal stakeholders.

For example, prioritize an easy-to-implement activity that can deliver good results based on previous similar activities over one that might deliver good results, but requires significant effort and technical resources or might get push-back from stakeholders.

### Step 3: Design

Design and develop activity plan with detailed information and approved experience visuals. 

Do this by: 

* Finalizing activity entry criteria and metrics needed to determine the performance of the activity.
* Completing and approving final designs for activity experiences.
* Documenting requirements for the [!DNL Target] activity, including test entry criteria, reporting metrics, and experience changes.

Use the Activity Planner, provided later in the welcome kit, to document the details of the activity, including the metrics you’ll use to measure activity performance, such as clicks on a call to action button, video launches, or revenue generated. Be sure to include screenshots or images of the experience designs you plan to test or personalize.

### Step 4: Build and run

Build and run the activity within [!DNL Target], develop any code if necessary, conduct QA testing, and launch the activity.

Do this by:

* Building an activity, applying any audiences, developing any code if necessary, and applying metrics to your activity.
* Securing sign-off from all required stakeholders.
* Launching the activity and reviewing metrics at one hour, at 24 hours, and periodically for the duration of the activity.

For example, if you want to target new visitors with a lightbox offer for 10% off their first order, you’d have your creatives develop the lightbox design and copy, get stakeholder sign off on the design, have your developers write the code for it, QA it in a staging environment, and then launch your activity. You’d then monitor the activity to make sure it doesn’t cause any major negative impact.

### Step 5: Analyze

Analyze activity performance and summarize activity results, insights, and recommendations. 

Do this by: 

* Leveraging data analysis and best practices to understand activity results.
* Analyzing audience performance to find valuable visitor segments.
* Documenting insights, results, and recommendations.

For example, you might discover that your returning visitors prefer a different experience than your new visitors.

### Step 6: Act and iterate

Operationalize winning experiences to realize business value, and iterate on insights. 

Do this by:

* Communicating activity insights, results, and recommendations to stakeholders.
* Gaining stakeholder approval to execute against activity recommendations.
* Defining and executing the plan to implement the winning experience.

For example, if your lightbox activity succeeded in increasing first-time visitor purchases, you might want to keep this activity going. Be sure to communicate the value the test drove to stakeholders and executives using the executive summary template included in the welcome kit. And consider how you can reapply this learning; perhaps you can target those first-time buyers with a second offer to get more value from each customer.

## Chapter 4: Tips for using Target

Based on our work with many [!DNL Target] users, we’ve observed ways that you can get more value from your [!DNL Target] solution. We’ve summarized those in the many tips we’ve included in this chapter. Although you might not be ready to use all of these ideas right away, hold on to this list. The more experience you get with the solution and the more your program matures, the more you’ll see how these tips can help you accomplish more with [!DNL Target].

### Tip 1: Deepen personalization by augmenting the visitor profile with additional data.

You can personalize experiences with [!DNL Target] data right out of the box. But personalize more deeply by adding your own data into the mix. You can augment your profile with historical data from [!DNL Adobe Analytics] and real-time data out of [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager]. You can also use Customer Attributes, a feature within the People core service in [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], to easily bring CRM data, second-party partner data, and third-party purchased data into [!DNL Target]. 

For example, you can associate purchase data from your point-of-sale system with a visitor profile. To do that, just create a CSV file with up to 200 offline variables, and either upload it directly into [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] via a file upload, or use FTP to host and schedule your file to be updated regularly. Once your Customer Attributes are in [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], you can map them to [!DNL Experience Cloud] solutions like [!DNL Adobe Analytics] and [!DNL Target] where they will be available for analysis, testing, and personalization.

See [Custom attributes](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/audiences/visitor-profiles/working-with-customer-attributes.html) for step-by-step instructions.

**Good to know**: Because [!DNL Target] is an open and agnostic platform that works well with different technologies, you can add CRM or purchased data in many different ways. That means you can choose a method that works best for your organization.

See [Methods to get data into Target](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/c-methods-to-get-data-into-target/methods-to-get-data-into-target.md) for more information.

### Tip 2: Personalize more deeply by blending Target audiences with other Adobe Experience Cloud audiences.

Blending audiences that live in different [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] solutions can give you a much broader understanding of your customers, as well as the ability to personalize more deeply. For example, although [!DNL Target] provides real-time audience data, [!DNL Adobe Analytics] provides historical audience data. Combining the two can help you identify when a customer’s behavior is consistent, and when there might be an opportunity to act on a new behavior. Simply click the drop-down menu next to “All Visitors” when creating an activity. Next, check the boxes of up to twenty audiences, click “Combine Multiple Audiences,” and click “Save.”

See [Combining multiple audiences](/help/c-target/combining-multiple-audiences.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Good to know**: [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager] audiences are available in [!DNL Target] automatically. But [!DNL Adobe Analytics] audience sharing requires a bit of manual set up. Simply check the box labeled “Make this an Experience Cloud audience” during the audience building process in [!DNL Analytics]. Then from [!DNL Target], click “Import Experience Cloud audiences.”

### Tip 3: Export data from Target to use with third-party tools.

With response tokens, administrators can easily get data out of [!DNL Target] and into third-party tools. This can be helpful when you want to add your data to data collected in a survey tool. For example, if a survey shows a sample of a population scored an experience a “9,” and another scored an experience a “4,” you can use your data to see who saw experience A and who saw experience B. You can also use response tokens to export [!DNL Target] data to your internal data warehouse. Simply click “Administration,” then toggle the switch next to the desired Response Token to the on position. Next, create an activity. The data is then ready to be transferred to the third-party vendor. You can verify that [!DNL Target] is exporting the data using debugging tools.

See [Response tokens](/help/administrating-target/response-tokens.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Helpful hint**: Before an administrator can activate a response token associated with a third party, a developer to needs to set up a partnership with that third-party company.

See [Response tokens](/help/administrating-target/response-tokens.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Do this first**: Make sure you are using at.js version 1.1 or later. If you are using a previous version, you’ll see the response tokens, but at.js won’t be able to use them.

### Tip 4: Build audiences from these key variables to increase the value of your activity.

When building audiences for targeting or testing promotions and offers, first consider these variables:

* Behavioral. Site visit patterns and purchase patterns
* Referrer. Referring sites and campaigns
* Temporal. Times of day, days of the week, and seasonal factors
* Offline. Visit and purchase patterns at physical stores
* Environment. Country of origin, operating system, browser type

### Tip 5: Give users the level of access they need to do their job.

Make it easy to work with your organization’s data while keeping it safe. [!DNL Target Premium] allows administrators to control the level of access given to different internal and external teams.

See [Enterprise user permissions](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/property-channel.md) for more information.

**Helpful hint**: When adding users, if the name of a team member has not been previously added to your organization, such as might be the case with a third-party agency employee, entering their email address and password will trigger an email invitation to join a team’s workspace.

Using Target Standard? You can still [assign three levels of access](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md) for your users with read-only, editor, and approver roles!

### Tip 6: Discover how an offer performs across a customer journey by testing it across each page in the journey.

See how an offer, such as free shipping, performs during a customer journey that takes place across multiple pages on your website.

See [Multipage activity](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/multipage-activity.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Helpful hint**: Changing the URL after you’ve specified a page range will reset the experience. That means the variations you specified will no longer appear. If you need to change the URL, remember to re-define the experience.

### Tip 7: Test an offer with different audiences to discover if audiences hae different preferences.

With Experience Versions, you can run one test with variations for as many audiences as you like. For example, you can create a banner ad offering free shipping—with imagery and currency variations for customers in the U.S., U.K., and the U.A.E.—without having to run tests for three different audiences.

See for [Multiple experience audiences in an A/B Test](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/target-experience-to-multiple-audiences.md) and [Experience versions in Adobe Target](https://helpx.adobe.com/target/how-to/experience-versions.html?playlist=/ccx/v1/collection/product/target/seg-%20ment/business-practitioners/explevel/beginner-adls/applaunch/how-to-2/collection.ccx.js?ref=helpx.adobe.com) for step-by-step instructions.

### Tip 8: Save time by replicating activity experiences on similar pages.

Create a variation on one web page, such as a new button color, and automatically apply it to all pages that share the same template. You can specify pages, or apply the variations to all similar pages across your website. 

See [Include the same experience on similar pages](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/temtest.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Tip 9: Reduce clutter in your Audience Library by creating one-time audiences.

If you’re targeting a segment you know won’t target again--for example, customers affected by an unexpected weather event--creating a one-time-use audience can help you get the job done without adding clutter to your Audience Library. This makes it easier to find audiences you use over and over again. 

See [Create an activity-only audience](/help/c-target/creating-activity-only-audience.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Highly requested capability**: Our customers asked us to make it possible to keep single-use audiences from being automatically saved to the Audience Library. Now, they no longer have to manually delete audiences to keep their libraries organized.

### Tip 10: Run simple tests faster by not putting them through the standard QA process.

There is nothing worse than having an activity ready to go and then waiting weeks for it to complete the standard QA process. You can QA most activities by simply passing around a few QA links to colleagues to try them on various browsers. You will most likely want to do more QA testing for efforts that dramatically change site function, but in reality, you should have fewer of those activities and far more of the more basic activities. Adding better rights controls so that fewer people can push things fully live also adds meaningful limits and lets you accomplish what you need to without sacrificing speed and efficiency. Another option is to have a designated IT resource to provide timely oversight of the QA process.

See [Activity QA](/help/c-activities/c-activity-qa/activity-qa.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Tip 11: Run tests on high-traffic pages so they reach statistical significance quicker.

Many marketers launch optimization programs for audience segmentation and targeting without checking whether traffic levels and audiences represented will provide significant results within the testing time frame for their optimization and conversion goals. To avoid this common mistake, answer these questions in advance:

* How many daily unique visitors does the page have?
* What is the conversion rate for the page?
* How long do you anticipate needing to run the test before you can confidently call it complete?

**Helpful Tip**: Use the Target [sample size calculator](https://docs.adobe.com/content/target-microsite/testcalculator.html) to help determine the sample size needed for a successful test.

### Tip 12: Design simpler tests to make sure you can create and implement them.

After considering all aspects of how to design a test, a plan can get very complex. Based on where your business is with testing, and your group’s ability to design, code,execute, and analyze the results, determine if the test seems too ambitious. If it is, be prepared to reduce its scope and complexity. Better to start small than not perform the test at all. You can’t deliver impactful lift if you never launch the test. It’s important to balance the aspirations of the team with the realities of your resources and abilities.

### Tip 13: Break complex tests into smaller test activities to make them achievable.

Instead of developing one large test with multiple variables and complex development, develop a less complex series of smaller tests with minimal variables. This allows for a deeper understanding of test performance based on specific variables. It also reduces possible technical issues that come with the development of larger projects.

### Tip 14: Maximize your test impact by testing closer to the end of the conversion funnel.

Testing as close to the page where visitors click Complete Purchase, Submit Application, or otherwise complete a conversion tends to deliver the most impactful results. Visitors who reach the end of the funnel are more qualified, have invested more time, and are ready to purchase, so testing insights about their preferences and actions can help you make profitable changes. Because pages on the purchase path are critical to conversion rates, tests being conducted on those pages should be socialized to key stakeholders before rolling them out.

### Tip 15: Constantly update your tests to make iterative improvements.

If your hypothesis did not prove to be true, think of ways to improve your test. Remember that even if none of the tested experiences performed better, your experiment wasn’t a waste of time. A successful test doesn’t always mean a boost in revenue or conversions. If the test actually supported your hypothesis, then you’re on your way to developing a general theory. But even when you do have a clear winning result, don’t stop there. Too often, marketers make the mistake of testing once and then banking on those results without really understanding what led to the success. Instead, plan to iterate on those results to figure out why the front-runner was ahead. This will lead you to deeper insights that you can use in future campaigns.

### Tip 16: Compare tests and personalization activities for ideas to improve targeting.

Comparing the conversion performance of different audiences within different tests at different locations can help focus and refine a company’s optimization strategy. Use test comparisons to identify which audiences are most valuable to test, which should receive targeted experiences, and what types of experiences are most likely to elicit a response. 

For example, a financial services customer ran a promotional campaign for a credit card that involved professional sporting event incentives. Through partial factorial multivariate testing of its landing pages, the customer was able to optimally balance messaging about credit card benefits with sporting incentives to target distinct audiences from its customer base. This approach allowed the company to capitalize on and maximize conversion during a time-sensitive window surrounding a major sporting event.

### Tip 17: Make tests useful by only launching them if you know you can act of the data.

A test is pointless if you aren’t clear about how you are going to act on the data. This includes knowing your key success metric, what needs to happen to push a winner, how you will follow up on test results, and what you will do with the audience information. For a speedy and successful test, it’s vital that every group involved in the test (developers, creatives, testing specialists, and others) is aware of its role before the test launch.

### Tip 18: Before launching a test, be sure the business supports pushing the winner.

Successful optimization organizations believe in the concept of testing and understand that their professional opinions about what experience will win the test don’t always prove true. They determine the winner based on a solid foundation of data, and are eager and willing to push the winning experience live after the results are in, even if it’s not in line with their expectations or seems counterintuitive. 

For example, an Adobe healthcare services customer recently demonstrated the value of testing by showing how a hero banner that the team had considered a slam dunk actually negatively impacted conversion. If your organization hasn’t yet fully embraced testing, it’s best to first conduct simpler, smaller scope tests so that changes from test results can be made incrementally.

### Tip 19: Let everyone know you've launched a test to avoid concern when the site changes.

One of the benefits of setting up your activities to use QA parameters is that you can share those links with everyone on your team. You make more people aware of the activity and ensure they don’t assume the site isn’t functioning properly when they hit a test variant. 

After you finish your tests, communicating campaign launches, test results, and especially lessons learned helps you build awareness of and interest in the test results. Sharing the results with everyone in the organization also avoids retesting a hypothesis, educates everyone about what works, and helps them fundamentally challenge their own ideas of what works based on what you’ve found. It’s a good idea to prepare a template that you use each time for sharing your findings and key learnings.
Then consider creating a sharable book or Microsoft PowerPoint deck that cumulatively captures these learnings.

### Tip 20: Tap into mobile functionality to create more innovative mobile activities.

The tablet and smartphone user experiences need to focus on touch-driven controls as the primary visitor interaction rather than mouse clicks and keyboard controls. Take advantage of mobile display controls, including finger swipe, touch, drag, pinch, and zoom. Use simple, large buttons to designate interactions and navigation,such as a large shopping cart or video play button. If designing for mobile retail, incorporate rich product visualization that is optimized for the device type. Always look for opportunities to shift the user experience focus to embedded, large viewers or full-screen interactive zoom and pan, 360-degree spin, and enhanced video functionality.

### Tip 21: Help mobile visitors find what they want by optimizing mobile search.

Mobile users have high intent. The majority of them use search before they do anything else on m-commerce sites, making mobile site search optimization crucial. To improve your search engine optimization (SEO) for mobile, use explicit navigational cues for easy browsing. Also, implement auto-suggest and autocorrect in search input boxes to address the difficulty of mobile typing. Provide compelling, relevant search results optimized for screen size and location.

### Tip 22: Reach mobile audiences better using time-of-day targeting for mobile SEM campaigns.

Understand how and when to reach your audience and how to better manage your daily advertising spend by “day parting” your mobile campaigns into different segments throughout the day.

Many marketers make the mistake of failing to allocate enough budget to capture that share of voice in the hours when the use of particular devices is heaviest, thus leaving a lot of revenue and leads on the table. 

For instance, tablet usage typically spikes in the evening hours, and many users browse while watching television. In contrast, smartphone users typically access content on the go. Peak conversion times also vary by industry, so it’s important to understand when your unique customers are most likely to act.
