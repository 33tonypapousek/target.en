# Allowlist Target edge nodes

Information and an up-to-date list of hosts to help you allowlist [!DNL Adobe Target] edges.

An edge is a geographically distributed serving architecture that ensures optimum response times for end-users requesting content, regardless of where they are located around the globe. Each edge node has all the information required to respond to the user's content request and to track analytics data on that request. User requests are routed to the nearest edge node. For more information, see [The edge network](/help/c-intro/how-target-works.md#concept_0AE2ED8E9DE64288A8B30FCBF1040934) in *How Adobe [!DNL Target] works*.

You can allowlist [!DNL Target] edge nodes, if desired. 

The following list includes the current hosts:

* `CLIENTCODE.tt.omtrdc.net`

  (where CLIENTCODE is your Target client ID)

* `mboxedge17.tt.omtrdc.net`
* `mboxedge21.tt.omtrdc.net`
