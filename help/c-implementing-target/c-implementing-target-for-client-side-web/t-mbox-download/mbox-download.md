# mbox.js implementation{#mbox-js-implementation}

To use Target Standard or Target Premium, add one line of code to call mbox.js.

 You can use either of two library references: [!DNL mbox.js] or [!DNL at.js]. [Benefits of at.js](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/c-target-atjs-implementation/target-atjs-implementation.md#benefits) explains the differences between the two libraries.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**mbox.js deprecation**: On August 30, 2020, Adobe Target will no longer support the mbox.js library. Post August 30, 2020, all calls made from mbox.js will fail and impact your pages that have Target activities running. We recommend that all customers migrate to the most recent version of the at.js library before this date to avoid any potential issues with your sites. For more information, see [How At.js Works](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/c-how-atjs-works/how-atjs-works.md).

>Although, mbox.js is currently supported, we have not provided feature updates to this library since July 2017. The newer at.js provides many advantages over mbox.js. Among other benefits, at.js improves page load times for web implementations, improves security, and provides better implementation options for single page applications.

>By moving all customers to at.js, our engineers and support staff will be able to provide you with new functionality and offer the support you have come to expect from Adobe.

The single reference to [!DNL mbox.js] on each page provides the libraries needed for all of your activities. [!DNL mbox.js] calls [!DNL Target] from every page that references the [!DNL mbox.js] file. This enables [!DNL Target] to do the following:

* Deliver Target activities 
* Track clicks 
* Track most success metrics

>[!TIP]
>
>To simplify implementation, you could reference [!DNL mbox.js] in your global header.

You do not need to maintain different activity-specific versions of the file. 

1. Reference [!DNL mbox.js] in the `<head>` section of each page on your site.

   `<script src="/ *`directory`*/ *`scripts`*/mbox.js"></script>`

   Where ` *`directory`*/ *`scripts`*` is the directory where you saved your [!DNL mbox.js] file after downloading it. 
If you already have mboxes on your page from a legacy implementation, these mboxes can still be used in the new interface. The updated [!DNL mbox.js] file is still required, but these mboxes can be selected for activities and edited using the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer].
