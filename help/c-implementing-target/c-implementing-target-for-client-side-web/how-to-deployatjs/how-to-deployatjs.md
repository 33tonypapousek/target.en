# How to deploy at.js{#how-to-deploy-at-js}

Information about how to deploy the Adobe Target JavaScript library, at.js, using Adobe Launch, without a tag manager, or using Adobe Dynamic Tag Management (DTM).

You can deploy at.js using the following methods:

* **[Implement Target using Adobe Launch](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/cmp-implementing-target-using-adobe-launch.md)**: Launch is the next-generation tag management platform from Adobe and is the preferred method to implement Adobe Target. Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences.
* **[Implement Target without a Tag Manager](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-without-a-tag-manager.md)**: You can implement Target without using a tag manager (Adobe Launch or Dynamic Tag Management).
* **[Implement Target Using Dynamic Tag Management](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-using-dynamic-tag-management.md)**: You can implement Target using Adobe Dynamic Tag Management (DTM), Adobe's legacy tag manager. Adobe Launch is the preferred, up-to-date method for implementing Target and the at.js library. For new Target implementations, use Launch.

To implement Target when using Single Page Apps (SPAs), see [Single Page Application implementation](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/target-atjs-single-page-application.md).
