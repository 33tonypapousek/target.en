# On-device decisioning

On-device decisioning provides the ability to cache your [!DNL Adobe Target] [!UICONTROL A/B Test] and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activities on your server and perform in-memory decisioning at near-zero latency, without blocking network requests to [!DNL Adobe Target]'s Edge Network.

For more information, see [Introduction to on-device decisioning](https://adobetarget-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/on-device-decisioning/introduction-to-on-device-decisioning) in the *[Adobe Target SDKs documentation](https://adobetarget-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/)*.
