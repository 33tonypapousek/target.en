# Create a Multivariate Test

**Creating Multivariate Tests (9:25)** 

This video demonstrates how to plan and create a multivariate test using the Target three-step guided workflow. 


* Define and design a multivariate test
* Create a multivariate test


>[!VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/X8w5IQqEOow) 

The Target point-and-click editor enables you to pick any location and add multiple offers. 

The multivariate test takes a page-first report. In other words, the test runs on a specific URL, with the experiences you design for that page. 

>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Create Activity]** > **[!UICONTROL  Multivariate Test]**.
