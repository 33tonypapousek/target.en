# Prerequisites and Integrations


Although most functionality remains the same whether recommendations are used alone or with other capabilities, some recommendation types are only available when used with other Adobe Marketing Cloud capabilities, as explained in [ Creating or Editing a Recommendation](../c_rec_mng_recs/c_Setting_Up_and_Deleting_a_Recommendation/t_create_edit_recs/t_create_edit_recs.md#task_07791608B4DB4B3EB0EF981116F4B4E2).
