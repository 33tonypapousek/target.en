# Preparing Your Website for Recommendations

Mboxes are special marketing boxes that enable you to dynamically change the content of selected areas on your Web pages based on information gathered about site visitors. 

If you do not set up mboxes on your pages, you can still create and test recommendations, but you cannot display dynamic content on your pages based on the test results. 

Typically, mboxes are set up by Web site designers, not the marketers who normally create and use recommendations. Setting up an mbox requires some familiarity with HTML coding and JavaScript, although you can follow the instructions in this guide even if you are not a Web designer. 

Implementing mboxes requires the following steps: 

>1. Download the [!DNL  mbox.js] file.
>1. Include references to the [!DNL  mbox.js] file on your Web pages.
>1. Create mboxes to contain the latest information about each product that you want to recommend.
>1. Create an mbox to capture order information.

>1. Create mboxes to display the recommendations.
