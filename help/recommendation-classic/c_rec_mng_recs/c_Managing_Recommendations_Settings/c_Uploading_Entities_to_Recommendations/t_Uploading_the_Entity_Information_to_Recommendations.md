# Uploading the Entity Information to Recommendations

Any data uploaded using the upload template file overwrites that value in our database, so if you send price information in JavaScript and then send different price values in the file, the values in the file override the info sent with JavaScript. 

>1. From the recommendations menu, click ` Settings`.

>       The Settings screen opens. 
>1. Click ` Uploads`.

>1. In the ` Entity Upload` section, browse to your save upload file, then click Upload.

>       It takes a moment for the upload to be processed. When the upload is complete, a message tells you how many data lines were processed and that the upload was successful. 

>       The product is available in the Admin interface approximately two hours after successfully uploading its entity.
