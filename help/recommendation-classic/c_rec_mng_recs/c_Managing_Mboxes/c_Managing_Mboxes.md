# Managing Mboxes

An mbox can also log the behavior of visitors to your site. Mboxes are defined in the code for each Web page. 

Mboxes are essential to campaigns and tests. Any mbox may do one, both or none of the following as you choose: 


* Display and swap content for visitors. 

* Log visitor behavior in real-time. 



The following image highlights an mbox that recommends two products.
