# Preparing for the Mbox

Your strategy and design determines the following: 


* The Web site locations of the mboxes needed to display recommendations
* The boundaries of the default content for each mbox The default content of display mboxes should be a size and shape that supports the offers (creative) designed for the recommendations. 

* The mbox names, which Operators will recognize when setting up recommendations Mbox names are case sensitive. Adobe recommendations recognize "Mymbox" and "myMbox" as two different mboxes.
