# Searching and Filtering the Recommendations List

The displayed recommendations can be filtered to show only active or inactive recommendations, if desired. This makes it easier to locate a specific recommendation. 

>1. On the ` Manage Recommendations` page, type all or part of a recommendation name in the ` Search` box.

>       As you type, the recommendations displayed on the page change to show only those that fit what you type in the ` Search` box. 
>1. To filter the search to show only active or inactive recommendations, select ` Active` or ` Inactive` from the dropdown next to the Search box.

>       By default, ` All` is selected, showing both active and inactive recommendations. 

>       You can also filter the list to show all active recommendations or all inactive recommendations by selecting either ` Active` or ` Inactive`from the dropdown without typing anything in the ` Search` box.
