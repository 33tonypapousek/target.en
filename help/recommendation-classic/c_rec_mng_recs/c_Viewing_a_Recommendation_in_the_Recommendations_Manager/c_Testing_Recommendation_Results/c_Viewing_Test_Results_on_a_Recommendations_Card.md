# Viewing Test Results on a Recommendations Card

The card shows the results for the top performing recommendation based on RPV, and for the "No Recommendation" control group. 

If you are testing multiple combinations of templates and algorithms, and want to see all of your results, not just the top performer, you can do so on the recommendation's edit page, as explained in [ Viewing Complete Recommendation Results](../../../c_rec_mng_recs/c_Viewing_a_Recommendation_in_the_Recommendations_Manager/c_Testing_Recommendation_Results/t_Viewing_Complete_Recommendation_Results.md#task_19A3022F3E2044CCA535F3CEC594300E).

You can compare this information to the same data without the recommendation to see whether your recommendation is improving sales. 

To compare data with and without a recommendation, mouse over either the recommendation type (such as ` Top Sellers`) or ` No Recommendation`. The data changes to reflect the selected data type.
