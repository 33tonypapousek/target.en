# Viewing Complete Recommendation Results


>[!NOTE]
>
>Report data remains in Recommendations for five quarters (including the current quarter).



>1. Click the recommendation whose results you want to view.
>1. Click ` Results`.

>       The test results display. Use the [!UICONTROL  Showing] menu to select the host group to display in the report. The report for the host group that is set as the default displays unless a different host group is selected. 

>       Use the radio buttons at the bottom of the results page to choose the control you want to use for the results. 

>       This report is automatically generated for each recommendation and shows the performance of all success metrics for your recommendation. 

>       Conversion information is gathered based on the mbox you have specified as your order confirmation page mbox (set by your consultant). The Time on Site and Page Views per Visit metrics are automatically captured, and every page with an mbox is used in that calculation. Any page with an mbox is counted once, even if it has more than one mbox. Therefore, an mbox on every page is required to get a true count of page views. 

>       A specific recommended item does not have to be purchased to count as a conversion. 

>       The "clicked" metrics give you a direct understanding of the influence recommendations had on a customer's decision to purchase by tracking whether the recommendation was clicked before something was purchased. Any purchase after the recommendation was clicked counts.
