# Reporting Recommendation Results

When you create a recommendation (see [ Creating or Editing a Recommendation](../../../c_rec_mng_recs/c_Setting_Up_and_Deleting_a_Recommendation/t_create_edit_recs/t_create_edit_recs.md#task_07791608B4DB4B3EB0EF981116F4B4E2)), you can set up tests by selecting multiple templates and algorithms. Each algorithm is tested against each template, and visitor traffic is split evenly between each test. For information on setting up algorithms and templates, see [ Selecting an Algorithm](../../../c_rec_mng_recs/c_Setting_Up_and_Deleting_a_Recommendation/t_create_edit_recs/t_algo_select_recs.md#task_2203616ABBE342B6ADAB08F278D794FA) and [ Selecting a Template and Recommendation Area](../../../c_rec_mng_recs/c_Setting_Up_and_Deleting_a_Recommendation/t_create_edit_recs/t_template_and_recommendation_area_recs.md#task_45CA0403F24944EF9FE6C4FC5D1A7836).
