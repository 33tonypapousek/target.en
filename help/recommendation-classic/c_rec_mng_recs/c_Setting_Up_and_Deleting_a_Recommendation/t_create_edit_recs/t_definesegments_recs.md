# Defining Segments

For example, if you present the same information to all users on your site, you can then use segments to determine how well your presentation succeeds with certain segments of visitors, such as visitors who are new to your site or visitors who have bought products from your site in the past. This information helps you determine how best to target your information so you show the right information to the best segments. Targeting a recommendation determines who sees the recommendation when they visit your site, as explained in [ Targeting a Recommendation](../../../c_rec_mng_recs/c_Setting_Up_and_Deleting_a_Recommendation/t_create_edit_recs/t_targeting_recs.md#task_3D93B8962F6341CB9A3ADE8E29BFECA5). You can add up to ten segments for each recommendation. 

>1. Create a new recommendation, or locate the existing recommendation you want to target and click ` Edit`.
>1. Under ` Testing and Segments`, click ` Add Segment`.
>1. In the first box of the segment builder, type the name of the segment you want to define.
>1. Specify the segment options.

>       ` People who have purchased before:` Any visitor who has bought an item from your site. 

>       ` People who have spent...:` People who have spent more than or less than a specified amount. When you select this target, additional options appear that let you select whether the target amount is less than or more than a specified amount. 

>       ` First time visitor:` People who have not visited your site before. Note that, if cookies have been deleted, a return visitor appears as a first time visitor. 

>       ` Returning visitor:` People who have been to your site before. 

>       ` Custom profile attribute:` (For testing and targeting users only.) People who have a particular profile value as defined in Target. When you select this option, additional parameters appear. In the first box, type the name of an in-mbox profile parameter, or a script profile parameter. (More information about these parameters is available in the Target help.) Next, select a delimiter from the menu, then type the value that must be met for the recommendation to show. 
>1. Repeat this procedure for each segment you want to define.
>1. Click ` Save`.
