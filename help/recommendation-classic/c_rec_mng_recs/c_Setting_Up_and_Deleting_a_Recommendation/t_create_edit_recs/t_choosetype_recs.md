# Choosing a Test Type

An **A/B Test** recommendation automatically splits traffic across all combinations of algorithms and templates you have set up. Optionally, traffic can be directed to default content as well to compare performance with and without recommendations. 

When you create an A/B test recommendation, you specify the percentage of visitors who see the default content. All others see the recommendations. 

The **Optimizing** recommendation ensures the most effective recommendations are shown more often by automatically displaying the best performing algorithm/template combination. As visitors respond to different combination over time, more traffic is automatically sent to the best performing combination. Visitors who fall into marketer-defined segments (set up at the bottom of the recommendation edit page) are sent to the best performing combination for that segment. 

Unlike A/B campaigns, where a visitor has the same experience until he converts, optimizing campaigns might serve a new experience per visit (or session). 

With an Optimizing recommendation, fewer visitors see underperforming combination. Automatically and over time, more traffic is shown to the best performing combinations. A small percentage is always sent to the underperforming combinations, in case there is a change and they start to perform better and even start beating the current winner. 

When you create an Optimizing recommendation, you specify the optimizing metric used to determine performance, which can be the conversion rate, average order value, or revenue per visit. You also choose whether to include default content in the calculations. 

To choose a test type: 

>1. Create a new recommendation, or locate the existing recommendation you want to target and click ` Edit`.
>1. Under ` Testing and Segments`, select the desired test type and the parameters used by the selected type.
