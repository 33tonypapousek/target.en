# Creating Catalogs

The backup recommendations generated for each algorithm within the recommendation also uses this catalog, so only items in the catalog are included in the backup recommendation. With catalogs, you can be sure that only products that make sense to show in a location are displayed. 

Catalogs are rebuilt or updated every time each algorithm runs. 

You can group your items into catalogs, then create separate recommendations for each catalog. 

>1. From the recommendations menu, select ` Products`, then click ` Catalogs`.
>1. Click ` Add New Catalog`.
>1. Type a name for the catalog.
>1. Select the parameter used to build the catalog.

>       For example, your catalog might be built around a product ID or category, margin, or any other parameter in the list. 
>1. Type one or more values for the parameter.
>1. (Optional) Add any other rules required for the category.

>       Multiple rules are joined with an AND. All specified rules must be matched for the catalog to apply. 
>1. Click ` Save.`
