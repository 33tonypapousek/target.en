# Creating a Custom Algorithm


>[!NOTE] {class="- topic/note "}

>Creating a custom algorithm requires the use of two APIs. This process should only be performed by advanced users.



To create a custom algorithm, you must use two APIs. 


* Name the custom algorithm
* Upload the data displayed by the custom algorithm


These APIs must be used sequentially in the order shown above. However, they can be done at different times. Also, after you have created the algorithm name, you can upload data whenever needed (for example, on a schedule to keep the information up to date) without repeating the Algorithm Name API call. 

You can also delete a custom algorithm, as explained in [ Deleting a Custom Algorithm](../../c_rec_mng_recs/c_Creating_a_Custom_Algorithm/r_Deleting_a_Custom_Algorithm.md#reference_B54C085BEAFB47B383DF127C06777D1F).
