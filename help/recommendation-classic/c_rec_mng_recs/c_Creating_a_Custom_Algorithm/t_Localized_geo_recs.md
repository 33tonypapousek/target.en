# Localized Recommendations Based on Geography


>1. Open a Recommendation and click **[!UICONTROL  Edit]**, or create a new recommendation and open the Edit tab.
>1. Define your algorithm.

>       There are three groups of geo-based recommendations: 

>    
>    * Hierarchical Hierarchical algorithms use Target data to create a tree that flows from general to specific information to fill the template. For example, you might specify user attributes that flow from store to city to state to country. If there are not enough recommendations for store to fill the template, then recommendations are added from city, then state, and finally country, until the template has been filled. 

>    * Sequential Sequential algorithms use Target data to run through a series of attributes that do not necessarily have a relation. For example, you might display items that match one color group, then another, at that match a specified gender and a then another attribute, such as location or age. If the first attribute does not fill the template, the next attribute is used, then the next until the template is filled. 

>    * No group Does not use either grouping.
