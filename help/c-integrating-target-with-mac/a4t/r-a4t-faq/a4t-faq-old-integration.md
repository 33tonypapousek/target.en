This topic contains answers to questions that are frequently asked about the legacy SiteCatalyst to Test&Target integration and using Analytics as the reporting source for Target (A4T).

## Why do I see an Activities report and a Campaign>Recipe report in Analytics? {#section_ECF18A7E759A4E7F93553DB187A677E9}

The SiteCatalyst to Test&Target integration (the old integration) and Analytics for Target (A4T) are different.

The Activities report is for the newer A4T integration.

The Campaign>Recipes reprort is for the legacy SiteCatelyst to Test&Target integration. Contact Client Care if you want to turn off this report. They can immediately turn off the report. The report will be hidden, but the underlying data is still available if it needs to be re-enabled.
