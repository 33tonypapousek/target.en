* [ I invited a user to Target, but his or her name does not display in the Users list (Setup &amp;gt; Users). ](c_troubleshooting-user-management.md#section_13A1A9697BA44537BA569C81CF136160)


## I invited a user to Target, but his or her name does not display in the Users list (Setup &gt; Users). {#section_13A1A9697BA44537BA569C81CF136160}

You will not see the new user listed on the [!UICONTROL  Users] page until the user logs in using his or her Adobe Experience Cloud account and then logs in to [!DNL  Target Standard/Premium] by clicking the [!DNL  Target] card.
