# Prepare to Implement Target

Following these guidelines and filling out the provided questionnaires will help you implement Target, whether you implement by yourself or work with Adobe Consulting (recommended). 

If you are working with an Adobe Consultant, it is not required that you know the information in these documents before implementing Target. However, being familiar with the documents Consulting will create and the questions they will ask can help to speed the pre-implementation process. These documents might be modified in the future. 

This section contains the following information:
