# Audiences

By default, traffic is split evenly between experiences. However, you can specify[ percentage targets](c_target/c_target_rulebased/c_target_percent.md#concept_9D0C47368EB942C9A66CE03C6BD92412) for each experience. 

Targets can also be [ rule-based](c_target/c_target_rulebased.md#concept_087408B488304A54917585D40482791A). A rule-based target is based on information gathered about the visitor, such as the visitor's location, browser, operating system, mobile device, or other data. 

You can [ combine percentage-based and rule-based targeting](c_target/c_target_rulebased/c_target_percentandrule.md#concept_D6B6F16F931C4E67AAB8F90621879FCC). For example, you might want to show a particular offer to 60 percent of visitors from California. When using the two targeting styles together, the rule is considered first, then the percentage. In this example, all California visitors are sampled first, then 60% of those visitors see the specified content. 

If you want to show the same content to everyone, but break out report data by group, use segment filters instead of targeting. 

When a visitor lands on a page where you have set up an activity, [!DNL  Target] determines whether the visitor qualifies as a member of an audience that has been identified for the activity. If the visitor cannot be identified as a member of a target audience, that visitor is shown default content and is not included in the reports for the activity. 

If the visitor is identified as part of a target audience, [!DNL  Target] determines which experience to display, based on the criteria established when the activity was created.
