## How can I tell whether A4T is enabled on my Target account? {#section_4437D284448F4313BF953D4B6EDBACA6}

Before a report suite can be selected when defining an Analytics activity, you need both an Analytics user account and a Target user account. Your user accounts must be configured as described in the documentation. See [ User Permission Requirements](c_account_reqs.md#concept_4BC06CAB00BF46FF9362AFE98656B083) . 

Once you are a member of one or more Experience Cloud groups that have access to Analytics and Target and you have access to all report suites, you should see the option to create an A/B test using Analytics under ** [!UICONTROL  Create Activity] **. 

If provisioning issues occur, check whether A4T is provisioned correctly.

Check the following if any of these problems occur: 


* Make sure your Analytics and Target accounts are linked in the Experience Cloud. 

* If you are using multiple Analytics company logins in the same Experience Cloud company, make sure that the last Analytics company you logged in to is the one that is tied to the Target account for the integration. 

* If you have been logged in to the Experience Cloud for several hours, sometimes the Analytics session can expire. Log out and log back in to try again.
