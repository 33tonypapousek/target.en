# Validate targeting to URL or referring URL parameters

Follow these steps to validate targeting to a URL or referring URL parameters.

1. Append the targeting parameters and values to the end of the URL, or referring page URL.

   The example below shows an appended target condition where your targeting condition is met when the keyword equals "chairs":

[!DNL http://www.yourcompany.com/asp/feature_item.asp?keyword=chair&categoryId=45] 
1. Confirm that you see the correct content for the targeting condition.
1. Delete cookies and confirm you do not see the content when you do not meet the targeting condition.
1. If segments filters are set, confirm reports correctly capture the URL parameter values.
