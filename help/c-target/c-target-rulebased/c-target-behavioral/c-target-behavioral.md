# Behavioral targeting

Behavioral targeting refers to all of the visitor data that can be stored and used to segment your population and target different content to different people based on their visitor profile

Some of the information you can track includes (but is not limited to):

* How often someone comes to the site 
* Whether they purchase items 
* How much they spend 
* Whether they are a member

All of these elements can greatly impact what you learn from your tests and other optimization activities.
