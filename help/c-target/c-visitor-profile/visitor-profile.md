Visitor profiles contain information about how your visitors use your pages and other optimized content locations

If your Target is used together with other Adobe Marketing Suite solutions, such as Adobe Analytics, Experience Cloud Audiences shares visitor information across solutions.

By default, Target profile information is stored in a single first-party cookie. The configuration can easily be changed to serve third-party cookies as well.
