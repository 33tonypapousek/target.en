# Locations

A location is the page or area on the page where an * [ offer ](c_offers.md#concept_40CA4EEBF72C430395ADB96C3A3D7DF4)* is displayed. An offer is the actual content that is displayed in the mbox. When a particular offer displays is controlled by an * [ experience ](c_experience.md#concept_B91F0F36E9F24AA58A3C6BC0A02871E8)*. 

Locations are essential to activities and experiences. You decide whether any location can do one, both, or none of the following: 


* Display and swap content for visitors.
* Log visitor behavior.


In [!DNL  Target Standard], a location can be any element on a page, as long as the page contains a single line of code that enables [!DNL  Target] in the ` &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;` section of each page you want to track. This line of code calls the JavaScript libraries needed to collect information and deliver targeted experiences to your visitors. 

See [ Implement Target ](c_target-implement.md#concept_60B748DE4293488F917E8F1FA4C7E9EB) for more information about the differences between location implementation in [!DNL  Target Standard] and the mbox implementation in [!DNL  Target Classic]. 

Locations are combined with [ audiences ](c_about_segments.md#concept_7CC998E8AC9C44F2926435D171361774) to provide an almost endless number of options for targeting information to your customers. For example, if a visitor has never been to the site before, you might display a discount coupon for new customers. Likewise, the page might be changed to display offers that are more optimized to returning customers. 

You can also use locations to track a visitor's progress through your Web site, or to track whether the visitor completes a specific success metric, such as adding an item to the shopping cart or completing a purchase.
