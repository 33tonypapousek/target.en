# Invite Users to Target


>1. Add the new user in the role-specific groups in the Enterprise Dashboard.

>       After you add a user, the user receives an invitation email. 
>1. After the user accepts the invitation and logs in to [!DNL  Target], configure the user's permission level on the [!UICONTROL  Users] page in [!DNL  Target Standard/Premium] ( **[!UICONTROL  Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL  Users]**).

>       You will not see the new user listed on the [!UICONTROL  Users] page until the user logs in using his or her Adobe Experience Cloud account and then logs in to [!DNL  Target Standard/Premium] by clicking the [!DNL  Target] card.
