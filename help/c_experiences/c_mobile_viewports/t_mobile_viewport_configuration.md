>1. Type a name for the mobile viewport.

>       Give your mobile viewport a descriptive name that is easy to recognize. The name can be up to 36 characters long. 
>1. Enter the screen size of the mobile device, both width and height.

>       The width can be between 150 and 968 pixels. The height can be between 150 and 1280 pixels. 


>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >For more information about viewports, see[ http://viewportsizes.com/](http://viewportsizes.com/). 

>1. (Optional) Select the operating system of the device.

>       Options: 

>    
>    * Android
>    * iOS
>    * Windows
>    * Symbian
>    * Blackberry


>       If you use the [ Enhanced Experience Composer](../../c_experiences/c_experiences.md#section_34265986611B4AB8A0E4D6ACC25EF91D) and choose an operating system, Target emulates that device when you view the page. If, for example, there is a different look and feel for Android than iOS on your responsive site, Target mimics that behavior. 
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Save]**.
