# Create a Cached Offer Stored on Your Site

Some examples of offers stored on your site (cached) include:

* Content, such as images, served by your site
* Form supported by script self-contained within the Web page that you serve from your site
* HTML code stored on the same site your adboxes are on
* Output with fewer variations, or smaller volume outputs

To create a cached offer:

>1. Make sure you do not need to serve dynamic content.

>       See [About Dynamic Content](c_About_Dynamic_Content.md#concept_657016A0E6174C22B89036E9C8A0170F) to help you guide your decision. This option does not support dynamic content but allows you to switch servers without requiring you to input the URL for the offer again. 
>1. Select ** `Offers` ** > ** `Create` ** > `Offer on your site`.
>1. Name your offer.
>1. Select the folder where the offer will be stored.
>1. Enter a relative URL pointing to a code snippet stored on your site (on the same domain the mbox that will contain this offer is served from).
>1. Click `save`.

>       The new offer shows up in the offers list.
>1. Use the new offer in a campaign or test.
>1. [Validate the offer](c_Validating_Offers.md#concept_60E81920A21A42ABA6980AF60697B260).
