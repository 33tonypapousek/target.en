# Creating an Audience

You can create your own customized audience and save it to the library for use in your activities.

>1. From the Audiences list, click ** `+` **.
>1. Type an audience name.

>1. Add a targeting rule.

>       If a rule contains multiple parameters, the parameters are joined by OR logic. If the audience contains multiple rules, the rules are joined by AND logic. For example, if the audience contains two rules, one for the site page the visitor visits and one for the mobile device the visitor is using, you might have two rules like the following:
>    
>    * Site Pages: Current Page URL contains `home.html` OR `cart.html` OR `wishlist.html`
>    * Visitor Profile: New Visitor

>       Because there are two rules, the rules are joined by an AND, so the audience must include one of the listed site pages and the visitor must be new.
>       You can also target mbox parameters. Under Custom Parameters, select an mbox, then specify the parameters.
>1. Click ** `Save` **.

>       The audience is added to the Audiences list and is available for reuse in other activities.
