## Target Standard {#section_ACD5EFF17AAB4E979CBEFA0145CCD905}

`Target Standard` is a front-end to `Adobe Target` that helps you visually create and manage A/B tests and rules-based targeting activities, and connect to the Adobe Marketing Cloud. `Target Standard` supports custom code insertion both in and out of the `Visual Experience Composer` workflow. `Target Standard` offers a simplified implementation strategy with your digital properties: just a single line of code on each page manages all communication required between your site and `Adobe Target`. 
Industry best practices are built into `Target Standard`, and it is designed to be used by both new and experienced users. You can share data and results and collaborate easily with other team members who use the `Adobe Marketing Cloud`. 
`Target Standard` will continue to be enhanced with functionality currently found in `Target Classic`, over the next several releases. 
For more information about the capabilities included in `Target Standard`, see [Getting Started](c_getting_started.md#concept_7F9DBAA507FD4F0C8E3678A7F1EEF9B4). 
The following video explains the activity types available in `Target Standard/Premium` and how Target's three-step guided workflow can help you achieve your site goals.
