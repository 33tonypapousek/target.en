# Tips for Targeting Groups



* All standard JavaScript operators ( == != < > &amp;&amp; || etc.) can be used, as well as accessible variables (for example, `landing.page.url`).
* You can reference both in-mbox and script [profile parameters](c_script_profile_attributes.md#concept_8C07AEAB0A144FECA8B4FEB091AED4D2). By defining and collecting profile parameters including time-on-site, lifetime monetary value and purchase frequency, you can use them as building blocks in custom target group expressions. See the link below for a full list of accessible variables and more examples.
