# Deciding Between Adobe Target Standard, Premium, and Classic

Keep the following in mind when deciding whether to use `Target Standard` or `Target Classic`: 

* You must update your `mbox.js` file (to v44 or later) or use `at.js` to use Target Standard. These updates are also useful for integrations with `Adobe Analytics`. For more information about the latest versions of these libraries, see [at.js Version Details](r_target-atjs-versions.md#reference_DBB5EDB79EC44E558F9E08D4774A0F7A) and [mbox.js Version Details](r_mboxjs_change_log.md#reference_DBB5EDB79EC44E558F9E08D4774A0F7A). 

* Communication with your sites is managed through Adobe's globally distributed Edge network, regardless of which interface you use. No changes have been made to this system. Although the Standard interface offers a new way to create activities, stability and performance of content delivery remains at the same level as before.

* Standard currently works best in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. If you require Microsoft Internet Explorer for your admin activities, continue to use Classic. Content delivery to sites works across all browsers in Standard, just as it does with Classic.
