# Enable Target in the SDK


>1. If you haven't installed the Adobe Mobile Services SDK in your app, use your Analytics or Marketing Cloud credentials and download the SDK from the [ Adobe Mobile Services ](https://mobilemarketing.adobe.com) website.

>1. Add the Adobe Mobile Services SDK to your app.

>       You can find the instructions under [ Core Implementation and Lifecycle ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/ios/dev_qs.html). 
>1. Add client code, timeout and enable SSL.

>       In the Marketing Cloud, open Mobile Services, then go to ** ` Manage App Settings` ** > ** ` SDK Target Options` **. 
>       Add your Target clientcode and timeout. The clientcode is unique to your account or company. The timeout is the time in number of seconds until which Target will wait for a response before showing the default content. Make sure the ** ` Use HTTPS` ** option is checked in the Manage App Settings page in Adobe Mobile Services. If HTTPS isn't enabled, all calls in iOS9+ will be blocked unless you whitelist the Target server.
