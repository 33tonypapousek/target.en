# Create User Groups


>[!NOTE]
>
>This "Beta" offering is enabled for a few customers in this release for testing and feedback. This documentation is a work-in-progress and will be frequently updated until this feature is released for all Target users.


You can create user groups, such as Developers, Analysts, Marketers, Executives, etc., and then assign privileges across multiple Adobe products and workspaces. Assigning a new team member all the appropriate privileges across different Adobe products can be as easy as adding them to a specific user group.

1. To access the `Admin Console for Enterprise`, go to [https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/) &gt; sign in using your Adobe ID, if you have not already logged in. 
   Or
   If you are already logged in to the Marketing Cloud, go to [http://www.marketing.adobe.com](http://www.marketing.adobe.com/), then click the `App` icon (  ![](graphics/icon_mc_apps.png) ) in the top navigation bar > click ** `Administration` ** on the right side > then click ** `Launch Admin Console` **. 

1. (Conditional) If you have access to the `Admin Console for Enterprise` for more than one organization, click the user avatar in the right corner or the top navigation bar, then select the desired organization. 

1. Click ** `User Management` ** > ** `User Groups` ** to create new user groups or to edit existing groups. 

1. Follow the instructions in [Manage Users and Groups in the Marketing Cloud](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/user_mgmt_admin.html) in the *Marketing Cloud and Core Services Product Documentation*.
