# Or and And Target Rules

In an "or" rule, the current page URL could contain any one of the entered conditions. The text at the top of the targeting widget puts the rule in sentence form so you can easily tell what the targeting conditions are. For example, you might want to target a test to URLs that are either the home page or a landing page.
An "And" rule creates stricter targeting rule by using multiple conditions. For example, visitors might be required to use the Chrome browser and be new visitors.
You can create complex rules by combining "and" and "or" rules. For example, you can combine "and" and "or" rules above to create a rule such as:
For additional control of your targeting rules, create an expression target as explained in [Expression Targets](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/tnt/help/t_Expressions_Targets.html) in the Target Classic help.
