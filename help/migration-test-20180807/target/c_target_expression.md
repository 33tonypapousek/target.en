# Expression Targets

For advanced users, these custom targeting groups permit targeting based on flexible JavaScript expressions evaluating to a boolean value. You can select this target in the targeting interface for the campaign, from the `Target Library` category. If the user matches the target (the target evaluates to "true"), the targeting condition is met. If the target evaluates to "false," the targeting condition is not met. You can also combine an expression target with other targeting options in the targeting interface. (Refer to the [JavaScript Expression cheat sheet](http://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/tnt/pdf/js_expression_cheat_sheet.pdf).) 
Some expression target functionality is specific to Target Classic. Refer to the Target Classic help for more information.
For best practices, see [Script Profile Attributes](c_script_profile_attributes.md#concept_8C07AEAB0A144FECA8B4FEB091AED4D2). 
You can use expression targets anywhere you would normally do targeting:

* Your campaign population selection
* Your experience population selection
* Success metrics
* Segments
