# Browser Options


## Type {#section_6ADC758F23F145B3A310151546D83D56}

Target or exclude a certain browser.
Select ** `Type` **, then choose either equals or does not equal. 

* Equals: Target the selected browsers.
* Does not equal: Exclude the selected browsers.

Select one or more browsers.
Multiple options are connected with an OR.

## Language {#section_7520D1AA464A45A6843EABE2D2B431A1}

Target or exclude a certain browsers that are set to use specific languages.
For example, if an offer is only available in English, you might target browsers with their language set to English. Or, if your page is not double-byte enabled, you might exclude browsers set to East Asian languages.
Including or excluding browser language can provide more accurate visitor targeting than targeting based on geography in cases where language is more important than location. For example, if you are offering an article written in English, you could either target English-speaking countries, or you could target browsers that are set to English. Targeting to the browser makes the article available to English speakers in countries where English is not the primary language.
Select ** `Language` **, then choose either equals or does not equal. 
* Equals: Target the selected browser languages.
* Does not equal: Exclude the selected browser languages.

Select one or more languages.
The following browser languages can be targeted or excluded:

* English
* French
* German
* Japanese
* Korean
* Portuguese
* Russian
* Spanish
* Traditional Chinese

Multiple options are connected with an OR.

## Version {#section_37CC8CE45DA04E8682AE6388321BA6EF}

Target or exclude certain browser versions.
For example, if your page does not appear correctly in Internet Explorer version 11 or earlier, you can create an audience that excludes those versions. In that case, you would set up a rule where the browser type equals Internet Explorer and add a second rule where the version is less than or equal to 11.
Select ** `Version` **, then choose an operator: 

* Equals
* Does not equal
* Is greater than
* Is greater than or equal to
* Is less than
* Is less than or equal to

Type the version number.
Only major versions can be entered in the text field. The specified version includes any minor version of that release. For example, if you specify version 10, visitors on version 10.1 are included.
Multiple options are connected with an OR.
