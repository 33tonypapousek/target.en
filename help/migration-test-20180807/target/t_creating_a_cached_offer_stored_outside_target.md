# Create a Cached Offer Stored Outside Target

Examples of offers stored outside Target include:

* Content from an ad server updated a few times a week
* Content, such as images, served by a third party server
* Form supported by script self-contained within the Web page
* HTML code stored by a third party
* Output with fewer variations, or smaller volume outputs stored on a third party site
