# Create Exclusion Groups

Exclusion groups are a great way to ensure that incompatible offers are not presented in the same experience in different locations. For example, suppose you have two offers: one is for 20% off of all merchandise and the other is for 15% off. You would never want these two offers to be presented to visitors in the same experience. If you add these two offers to an exclusion group, you can ensure that this will never be the case.
**To create an exclusion group:** 

>1. While creating or editing an AP activity, click ** `Manage Content` ** in the header bar.
>1. in the `Manage Content` dialog box, click ** `Exclusion Group` **.

>       ![Step Result](graphics/exclusion group create.png) 
>       If you have previously created exclusion groups, they display in the list. If you have not yet create an exclusion group, you are prompted to create one.
>1. Click ** `Create Exclusion Group.` **

>       ![Step Result](graphics/exclusion group create dialog.png) 
>1. (Required) Specify a descriptive name for the exclusion group.

>       A descriptive name helps you or others quickly locate and understand a group's purpose.
>1. Locate and select the desired offers that you want to add to the exclusion group.

>       Because it makes sense that you select only one offer in a specific location, when you select an offer, all other offers in the same location are greyed out.
>1. Click ** `Save` **.
