# Targeting Display to a Prerequisite Success Metric


>[!NOTE] {class="- topic/note "}
>
>Do not confuse this feature with success metrics reporting, which impacts only reporting, not display.


Be cautious using this feature. Complete a thorough QA and consult your account representative to ensure this is the best solution to meet your needs.

>1. Set up success metrics as you would for a Success Metric report.

>       One of these success metrics must have selected the prerequisite mbox.
>1. At the Experience or Mbox Level, target the content to display only when the Prerequisite success metric `has been seen` or `has not been seen`.

>       **Warning!** Do not target display to a success metric at the campaign level. The result will be that the visitor is locked out of the campaign.
