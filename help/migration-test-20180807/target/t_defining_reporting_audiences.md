# Define Reporting Audiences


>1. Create an [activity or test](c_activities.md#concept_D317A95A1AB54674BA7AB65C7985BA03).
>1. If you will be targeting on a success metric, [set up your success metric](r_success_metrics.md#reference_D011575C85DA48E989A244593D9B9924) first.
>1. On the bottom left of the Campaign Create/Edit Page, click `Setup Segments` if the segments section is not already open.
>1. Click `Add Segment`.

>       Add as many segments as you need and rename them.
>1. Click `Show Details` and select the criteria for including a visitor in reports.
>1. Select the desired user qualification criteria.

>       Choose either:
>    
>    * Any visitor to the campaign
>    * Only visitors who reach a certain success metric
>    * Only visitors who reach conversion

>1. Choose the parameter type.

>       The available options are similar to those used for targeting. See [Targeting Rules](t_Setting_Targeting_Rules.md#task_75C6702BE0AC45E9A0B9DB26FDBB18B2) for more information. 
>1. For your chosen parameter, insert all the conditions required for the new report segment.

>       You can add as many conditions as necessary to define your segment, including comparisons like "contains," "does not contain," etc. Click to review comparison types. You can even take advantage of [regular expressions](c_Using_Regular_Expressions_in_Targeting_Groups.md#concept_320777558B7F45C5AEC2D548BA2E380D) by using targeting groups. 
>       For example, you can segment out all your referrals that come from Google domains outside the US. You can create a segment for all users whose Landing Target is "From Google" but that does not contain .com or .us.

>       >[!NOTE] {class="- topic/note "}
>       >
>       >Multiple values can be assigned to a single condition by separating the values with a new line. See[Or and And Target Rules](c_Or_and_And_Target_Rules.md#concept_C7F197A3D399447E9E143599A3715099). 

>1. Click `Done` when you have added all the conditions that define your segment.
>1. Click `Save` or `Save &amp; Approve`.
