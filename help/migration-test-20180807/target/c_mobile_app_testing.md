# Mobile App Testing

There is a single Adobe Marketing Cloud SDK that can be used for testing mobile apps across all Marketing Cloud solutions. For details about using this SDK, refer to [iOS SDK 4.x for Marketing Cloud Solutions](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/ios/overview.html). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe is sunsetting support for the older versions of the SDK.
