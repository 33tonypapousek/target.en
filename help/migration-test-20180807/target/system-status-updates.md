# System Status Updates

Access the `System Status` page by going to the following URL: 
[ `http://status.adobe.com`](http://status.adobe.com) 
![](graphics/system status.png) 
The available statuses include:

<ul class="simplelist"> 
 <li>Normal</li> 
 <li>Minor Incident</li> 
 <li>Major Incident</li> 
 <li>Reported Event</li> 
 <li>Maintenance</li> 
</ul>


`Ad Hoc Analysis` and `Marketing Reports &amp; Analytics` were undergoing maintenance when this illustration was created. All other products and solutions were functioning normally. It is always good practice to check this page if you experience problems when using Target. 
An in-product notification always displays during the monthly `Target` release, but minor updates sometimes occur and will be listed on this page.
