# Target Library

The pre-built audiences in the Target Library category are legacy audiences and exist in other categories. For more information and best practices, see [Targets and Audiences Frequently Asked Questions](c_troubleshooting_targets_and_audiences.md#concept_C4EE4B8F4840430CBD798D579A8F208D).

This functionality is not included in Target Standard/Premium. For alternative methods, see "I use Expression Targets" in[Advanced Feature Considerations](c_trans-advanced-feature-considerations.md#concept_D8DB7801889A464D9197A739F7B185A7).
