# Time Frame

For example, using the [combined, ad-hoc audiences feature](c_combining-multiple-audiences.md#concept_A7386F1EA4394BD2AB72399C225981E5), you can target low-spenders with specific content during the three days leading up to Black Friday and other content after Black Friday. 

1. In the `Target` interface, click ** `Audiences` ** > ** `Create Audience` **. 

1. Name the audience.

1. Click ** `Add Rule` ** > ** `Time Frame` **. 
   ![](../graphics/target_timeframe_dialog.png) 

1. Specify the Start and End dates and times for the audience.
   Leave the start date empty to start targeting according to the activity's schedule. Leave the end date empty to continue targeting until the activity's end date and time.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Time zone is displayed as GMT +/- NN:NN, where NN:NN is the offset from GMT and reflects the account-level time zone rather than the visitor's time zone. For example, California's time zone would be displayed as GMT +08:00.


1. (Conditional) Click ** `Week and Day Parting` ** to set recurring patterns, including days of the weeks and times. 
   ![](../graphics/week and day parting.png) 
   You could use Week and Day Parting options, for example, to display a "Chat Now" option to visitors only during the days and hours that your call center is staffed.
   Select one or more days of the week, then set the start and end times. Click `Add More`to specify additional patterns, as desired. 

1. (Optional) Click ** `Add Rule` ** and set up additional rules for the audience. 
   Note that you can repeat Step 5 for each rule, if desired.

1. Click ** `Save` **.
