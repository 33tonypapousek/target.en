# Add Users


>[!NOTE]
>
>This "Beta" offering is enabled for a few customers in this release for testing and feedback. This documentation is a work-in-progress and will be frequently updated until this feature is released for all Target users.


When you start using the new `Properties` functionality, all user management must be performed in the `Adobe Admin Console for Enterprise`. However, all of your existing users in `Target` will be migrated from `Target` to the `Admin Console for Enterprise`. 

1. To access the `Admin Console for Enterprise`, go to [https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/) &gt; sign in using your Adobe ID, if you have not already logged in. 
   Or
   If you are already logged in to the Marketing Cloud, go to [http://www.marketing.adobe.com](http://www.marketing.adobe.com/), then click the `App` icon (  ![](graphics/icon_mc_apps.png) ) in the top navigation bar > click ** `Administration` ** on the right side > then click ** `Launch Admin Console` **. 

1. (Conditional) If you have access to the `Admin Console for Enterprise` for more than one organization, click the user avatar in the right corner or the top navigation bar, then select the desired organization. 

1. Click ** `User Management` ** > ** `Users` ** to create new users or to edit existing users. 

1. Follow the instructions in [Manage Users and Groups in the Marketing Cloud](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/user_mgmt_admin.html) in the *Marketing Cloud and Core Services Product Documentation*.
