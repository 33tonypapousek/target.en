# Automated Personalization


>[!NOTE]
>
>Automated Personalization is available as part of the Target Premium solution. It is not included with Target Standard without a Target Premium license.


Marketers implement one file on their site and that enables them to point and click on any content and then visually create and select additional content options for that area. Then, the modeling system automatically determines which piece of content to deliver to each individual based on all behavioral data the system has about the visitor. This provides a personalized experience for each visitor. The marketer does not need to run a test, then analyze the results, then deliver a winner before realizing the lift found from optimization.
Automated Personalization provides:

* Two machine-learning algorithms: 
    * Decision Tree Ensemble
    * Residual Variance Model

* Single line of code implementation with WYSISYG content editing
* Connection to the Master Marketing Profile for seamless collection of advance visitor behavioral data
