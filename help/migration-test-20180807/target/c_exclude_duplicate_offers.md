# Exclude Duplicate Offers

You might have an activity, for example, with six locations on a page with 12 offers. There is a chance that the same offer could be placed in one or more locations in the activity. This feature prevents duplicate offers from displaying in the same activity.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you select to exclude duplicate offers after creating exclusion groups, the experience count on the activity diagram may be incorrect.


Click ** `Configure` ** > ** `Duplicate Offers` **, then click ** `Allow Duplicates` ** or ** `Disallow Duplicates` **.
