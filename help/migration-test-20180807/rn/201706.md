>[!NOTE]
>
>Stay tuned in the coming days for Response Tokens, which allow you to perform integrations with 3rd-party solutions. Response tokens let you choose from a list of all eligible Target variables and values to output with each Target server call for integration with 3rd-party providers (Clicktale, for example). This replaces the plug-in functionality in `Target Classic`. 


This `Target` release includes the following customer-facing enhancements and fixes: (issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use): 

* Improved the workflow when a user's `Target` session times out while creating or editing an activity or offer. When the user clicks `Save`, the session-expired message displays, but after logging back in, a dialog informs the user of a successful login and the UI remains on the same page in `Target` with no data loss. 
  If a user performs intermittent action on a `Target` page and experiences a session timeout, the user is directed to re-log in and is then directed to the last page worked on in the `Target` UI. 

* Fixed an issue that caused custom code changes to be lost if the user browses away (changes experiences, switches page, switches audience, clicks Next, etc.) and forgets to save changes. The user is now prompted to save the changes. (TGT-23766)

* When an activity is archived, "Archived the activity" displays instead of "Updating the activity." (KB-1517)

* The drop-down picker in the following locations within the Target UI has been replaced with auto-complete functionality to improve speed and performance: (TGT-22939)

    * Activity Page &gt; *activity* &gt; Step3 &gt; Report Suite picker 

    * Audiences &gt; Create Audience &gt; Visitor Profile

    * Recommendations &gt; Feed Creation &gt; When source type &gt; Analytics &gt; Report Suite picker



* Improved error messaging when a site has "X-Frame-options" set to SAMEORIGIN and the site cannot be loaded in the Visual Experience Composer (VEC). The message prompts the user to switch to the Enhanced Experience Composer in Setup &gt; Preferences. (TGT-17356)

* Reports in Target Standard/Premium now display in your account's time zone rather than the Target server time zone (US EST). (TGT-24868)

* If activities created in `Target` are updated from outside of `Target` (for example, via Adobe I/O), the following activity attributes are imported back into `Target`: 
  `thirdpartyId` 
  `startDate` 
  `endDate` 
  `status` 
  `priority` 
  `marketingCloudMetadata(remoteModifiedBy)` 
  This import job will run when the activities page is opened, with a maximum delay of ten minutes. (KB-1526)
