 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1">Create and edit profile scripts</td> 
   <td colname="col2">Profile scripts run profile attribute "catchers" on each mbox request. When an mbox request is received, Target runs any relevant profile scripts, determines which activity should run, and displays content that is appropriate to that activity and that experience, then tracks the success of the activity. This enables you to track information about the visit, such as the visitor's location, time of day, number of times that visitor has been to the site, if they've purchased before and so on. This information is then added to the visitor's profile so you can better track that visitor's activity on your site.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1">Confidence interval for binary metrics</td> 
   <td colname="col2">Updated reports using Target-based data show the confidence interval of the lift, compared to the control.</td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1">Download export activity report data</td> 
   <td colname="col2">Download data in a .csv format for quick import into Excel or other data analysis programs. This feature works for A/B, Experience Targeting, and Multivariate activities.</td>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1">Rich text and HTML editing in Visual Experience Composer</td> 
   <td colname="col2">Text formatting options are available when editing text and HTML for A/B and Experience Targeting activities in the Visual Experience Composer. You can choose a font, select a font style, change text alignment, and other standard text formatting options. When modifying HTML, you can toggle between the code view and rich-editing view of the HTML.</td>

This new functionality allows the Offer Detail report to report using lift and incremental conversions, metrics that are aligned with the optimization goal. Previously, the Offer Detail report in Automated Personalization always reported on revenue even though the optimization goal was a click-based conversion rate, whether or not the activity had revenue being passed in. This required marketers to specify "estimated revenue per conversion" in the Goals and Metrics page for the report to be meaningful. </entry> </row> -->
