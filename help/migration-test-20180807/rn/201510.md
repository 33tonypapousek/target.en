## Target Platform Enhancements {#section_9B930A0320D244338B15A411D717315E}


* Increased the mbox parameter value length limit in the Server Side Delivery API to 5000 from 256.
* You can now select the format of the response in the content field when using the Server Side API. Append the `"contentAsJson" : "false"` parameter to the request if you do not want the response returned as Json. When the response is returned as Json, it is included as a dictionary rather than a raw attribute.

Only report suites that are provisioned to connect to Adobe Target will be available for selection.

Multiple weightings can be applied to the same algorithm, and the weightings can be tested on split traffic in the recommendation.</p> <p>
