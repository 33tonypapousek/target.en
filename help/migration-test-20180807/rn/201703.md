This `Target` release includes the following enhancements and fixes:: 

* The `Target` user interface has been updated to support redirect offers in activities that use `Analytics for Target` (A4T) as the reporting source. This functionality will require `at.js` 0.9.6. 

* The `Target` user interface was updated in some places: 

    * In reports and activities, some options ( `Edit`, `Share to Feed`, `View Experience URLs`, etc.) are now accessed by clicking the `More Options` icon (  ![](../graphics/icon_more_options.png) ). 

    * In the `Offers` library, offers now display in a list rather as cards. Other minor UI changes were made throughout the `Offers` library UI. 


* Significantly improved performance on the `Activity` and `Audience` lists. Also, load times for search results return significantly faster. 

* "Views" is now "Visits" in the `Offer Level Report` for `Automated Personalization` reports. 

* `Target` now supports switching of environments (host groups) for `Automated Personalization` activities. 

* `Automated Personalization` activities now support host groups.
