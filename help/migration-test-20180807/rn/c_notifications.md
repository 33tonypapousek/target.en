# Adobe Pulse Integration

Notifications from Target can be seen in all solutions by users who have a Marketing Cloud product context of Target Classic, Target Standard/Premium, or both.
For information about setting up Notifications, refer to [Notifications](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/notifications.html) in the Adobe Marketing Cloud documentation. 
Access Notifications from anywhere in Target, except from within the activity creation workflow. Click on the bell icon to display notifications. Click on the bell icon again to hide notifications.

Target sends two kinds of notifications for all activity types:

* When an activity becomes live and offer delivery can be seen: For example:
  ![](../Target/graphics/notif_app.png) 

* When an activity is deactivated and offer delivery ceases: For example:
  ![](../Target/graphics/notif-deact.png) 


Similar notifications also appear when an activity is scheduled to go live, and when it has ended after reaching its end date.
All Target notifications show the name of activity that was approved or deactivated, and include the words "Adobe Target for easy identification.
If a single activity send multiple notifications of the same type, a number displays in the notification. For example:

Click on the notification card to view details of each individual notification.
For example, if you click the card shown above, the three notifications display:

1. MVT notifications appear as 'A/B Test' notifications since they are synced as A/B..N campaign in T&amp;T.
