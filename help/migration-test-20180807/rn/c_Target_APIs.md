# Target APIs

Using the APIs to provide this content depends on your ability to do the following:

* Retrieve campaign report information
* Synchronize website visitor profiles between your platform and Target
* Create offers outside of Target
* Provide a mechanism to easily guide your users to the campaign creation process
