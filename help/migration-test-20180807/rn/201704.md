      <li id="li_4117C900982240B5AFFCFE1B2716A443"> <p>Redirect offer support for A4T. After you download and install <span class="filepath">at.js</span> version 0.9.6, you can use redirect offers in activities that use <span class="keyword">Adobe Analytics</span> as the Reporting Source for <span class="keyword">Target</span> (A4T). Besides <span class="filepath">at.js</span> version 0.9.6, there are other minimum requirements your implementation must meet in order to use redirect offers and A4T.

This could lead to issues like unstitched hits in <span class="keyword">Analytics</span> when using A4T. </p> <p>This behavior has been changed in <span class="filepath">at.js</span> 0.9.6, even if the <span class="codeph">visitorApiTimeout</span> is set to say 1 ms, Target will try to collect SDID, tracking servers, and customer IDs data and send those in the Target request. </p> </li> 
      <li id="li_B11CE11D9A594CB1ABB85BD0D93C4A15"> <p>Added the <span class="codeph">selectorsPollingTimeout</span> setting.
