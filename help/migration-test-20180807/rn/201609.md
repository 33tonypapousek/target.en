      <li id="li_689FF306179F4EC3B391DEE3C53F4B1D"> <p>Added an <span class="codeph">optoutEnabled</span> setting to enable or disable the Device Graph opt-out. If this setting is set to <span class="codeph">true</span> and the visitor has opted out of tracking, the visitor's browser will not make any mbox calls. Device Graph is currently in Beta. This setting is set to <span class="codeph">false</span> by default, but must be set to <span class="codeph">true</span> if you are using Device Graph. A similar option is part of <span class="codeph">mbox.js</span> v61. </p> </li> 
      <li id="li_663462C0680049F89CA8FE1853F31807"> <p>Added <span class="codeph">CustomEvent</span> support for the notification mechanism. Previously, the <span class="codeph">at.js</span> event notification mechanism could not be used via standard DOM APIs, such as <span class="codeph">document.addEventListener()</span>. Now you can use<span class="codeph">document.addEventListener()</span> to subscribe to <span class="codeph">at.js</span> events, such as request events and content rendering events. </p> </li> 
      <li id="li_3FB2914F8D2F4AFFAA9B4622E8CA1EFF"> <p>Fixed an issue related to offers created in the Visual Experience Composer (VEC). Prior to this release, Target hid the selectors and un-hid them only when all selectors matched. In <span class="codeph">at.js</span> 0.9.2 Target un-hides the selectors as soon as they are matched. </p> </li>
