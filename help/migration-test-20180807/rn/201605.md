**Enhancements** 
Improvement made to improve the A4T provisioning process.
**Known Issues** 
The following known issues have been reported:

* When "Disable JavaScript" is selected for page A in a multipage activity, JavaScript is disabled everywhere, even though "Disable JavaScript" isn't selected on other pages.
* Issue with experience preview URLs for experiences with a redirect. As a workaround, in the Experience Composer, click ** `Configure` **, choose ** `Multiple Audiences` **, and add ** `All visitors` ** as the only audience. Continue to save your activity. This does not change the delivery of your activity, but allows preview to work. This will be fixed in the July release of Adobe Target.
