**Enhancements, Fixes, and Changes** 
This `Target` release includes the following customer-facing enhancements, fixes, and changes: (issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use): 

* We've added more places where you can view audience definition details on a pop-up card in the Target UI without opening the audience. Note that this functionality applies only to audiences created in `Target Standard/Premium. (TGT-25772)` 

* You can now view definitions of adhoc audiences inside activity creation/overview. (TGT-25570)
