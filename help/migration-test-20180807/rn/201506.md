   <td colname="col2"> <p>Once a predictive model passes the required quality criteria and is deemed valid, it is considered ready and is used to calculate a personalized score for offer decisioning. A clock icon changes to a check mark when the model is ready and Target is able to begin delivering personalized content. Since lift is expected only after the models are ready, the visual indication allows you to set the right expectation. Use the traffic estimator in the Visual Experience Composer to get a guideline of when the models will be ready.</p>

Once on the page you want to test, flip the Visual Experience Composer back to "Compose" mode and create your experiences. For example, you can change a message on the Shipping page, then test it against the default.</p> </td>
