## New Target Implementation Library, at.js v 0.8.0 (May 5, 2016) {#section_6A44C277E82D409AB6DCD0901F43794A}

at.js is a new implementation library for Target designed for both typical Web implementations and single-page applications.
at.js replaces mbox.js for Adobe Target implementations.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Although at.js replaces mbox.js, mbox.js will continue to be supported. For most people, at.js provides advantages over mbox.js. This gives you time to test at.js and to change the implementation on your pages.


Among other benefits, at.js improves page load times for Web implementations, improves security, and provides better implementation options for single-page applications.
at.js contains the components that were included in target.js, so there is no longer a call to target.js.
When implementing at.js, be aware of the following:

* Internet Explorer versions earlier than 8 are not supported.
* Asynchronous implementation means legacy integrations like the Test&amp;Target to SiteCatalyst plugin may not work.
* Target plugins that reference mbox.js objects and methods are not supported.
* All calls to Target are made via XMLHTTPRequest and content is returned via JSON.


## Target Platform Changes {#section_8295A808A4CE405C9DA2893E7935238E}


* Mbox.js version 60 is now the default download.
* Mbox.js versions earlier than 50 are no longer actively tested. If your implementation is not yet updated, ensure additional QA is performed on all Target content delivery and reporting collection.
* Flash campaigns and other Flash-related items have been removed from Target.
* Internet Explorer 10 is no longer supported in the Target interface.
* Support for content delivery in Internet Explorer 8, 9, and 10 is expected to end in an upcoming release. Active testing will be discontinued in a future release for these browsers, following the end of active support for these browsers by Microsoft. Target will continue to deliver content to these browsers, but you should test content delivery and data collection for reports.



## Adobe Target Standard/Premium 16.4.1 Fix (May 5, 2016) {#section_70552F61E83140C7B4D2A245198B630E}


* at.js v 0.8.0 is now available for download from the Target interface.
* Target APIs changed. ` applyOffer` now requires ` mbox param [0]`. 
  ```
  adobe.target.applyOffer({ 
      "mbox": "target-global-mbox", 
   "params": {"test": "true"}, 
      "selector": ".banner-text", 
      "offer": offer 
  });
  ```
