**Enhancements, Fixes, and Changes** 
This `Target` release includes the following customer-facing enhancements, fixes, and changes (issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use): 

* Users with Approver permissions can now generate and enable profile API authentication tokens. (TGT-24074)
  For more information, see [Profile API Settings](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/ov2/c_profile-api-settings.html). 

* When creating an activity in the Visual Experience Composer and the user reloads the page, the activity URL and associated properties are retained in the UI. The need to reload can occur if the activity uses mixed content (secure and insecure content) or there are permission issues. (TGT-28230)

* Improved the messaging when an activity uses mixed content (secure and insecure content). The message provides information to help users perform the necessary steps needed to open an HTTP site or a site that has mixed calls (HTTPS and HTTP). (TGT-26271)
  For more information, see [Enabling Mixed Content in Your Browser](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/c_mixed_content.html). 

* Improved the workflow when a user's Target session times out while configuring options on the Setup, Audiences, and Recommendations pages. When the user clicks Save, the session-expired message displays, but after logging back in, a dialog informs the user of a successful login and the UI remains on the same page in Target with no data loss.
