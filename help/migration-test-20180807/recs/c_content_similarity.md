# Content Similarity

Content similarity compares item attribute keywords and makes recommendations based on how many keywords different items have in common. Recommendations based on content similarity do not require past data to deliver strong results.
Using content similarity to generate recommendations is especially effective for new items, which are not likely to show up in recommendations using *People Who Viewed This, Viewed That* and other logic based on past behavior. You can also use content similarity to generate useful recommendations for new visitors, who have no past purchases or other historical data. 
When you select ** `Items` **/ ** `Media with Similar Attributes` **, you have the option to create rules to increase or decrease the importance of specific item attributes in determining recommendations. For items such as books, you might want to boost the importance of attributes like *genre*, *author*, *series*, and so on, to recommend similar books.

Because content similarity uses keywords to compare items, some attributes, such as *message* or *description*, can introduce "noise" into the comparison. You can create rules to ignore these attributes. 
By default, all attributes are set to *Baseline*. You do not need to create a rule unless you want to change this setting.
