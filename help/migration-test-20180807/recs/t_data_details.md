# Inclusion Rules

Inclusion rules are optional; however, setting these details gives you more control over the items that appear in your recommendations. Each detail you configure further narrows the display criteria.
For example, you can choose to display only women's shoes that have an inventory of more than 50 and a price between $25 and $45. You can also weight each attribute so those items that are more important to your business are most likely to appear.
As another example, you can choose to display job openings to visitors who visit your site only from certain cities and who have the required college degrees.
Inclusion rule options vary by industry vertical. By default, inclusion rules are applied to backup recommendations.

>You should use inclusion rules cautiously. They are useful if, for example, your organization has rules that demand that one brand is not recommended while another brand is being shown. However, there is an opportunity cost to this feature. You could possibly lose a percentage of lift by restricting some items from not showing when they would normally be shown by the activity criteria.


The inclusion rules are joined with an AND. All rules must be met to include an item in a recommendation.
To create a simple inclusion rule, as mentioned previously, to display only women's shoes that have an inventory of more than 50 and a price between $25 and $45, perform the following steps:

>1. Set a price range for the products you want to recommend.
>1. Set the minimum inventory amount for the products you want to recommend.
>1. Configure the recommendation to display items only when they meet certain criteria.

>       You can specify that items are included only when one of the attributes in the list meets or does not match one or more specified conditions.
>       The available evaluators depend on the value you choose in the first drop-down. You can list multiple items. These items are evaluated with OR.
>       Multiple rules are combined with an AND.
