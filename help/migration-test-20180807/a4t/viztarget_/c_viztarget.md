# Visual Experience Composer

An activity can contain more than one experience. For example, 50% of visitors who are referred to your site from Google might see an offer for two-day shipping, but the other 50% see an offer for a $30 discount on ski boots.
The Visual Experience Composer provides a way to visually identify the components of a Target-enabled page and to modify portions of the page directly rather than requiring you to use the Target application.
When you hover over an element on your page, a blue highlight appears, describing the element. Click on a highlighted element for a menu of options available for that element type For example, you can click on an image and select ** `Edit Image` ** to change the image, or click on a button and change the HTML. You can use the buttons at the top left of the page to toggle the overlays on and off. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Certain browsers, such as Firefox, might block a page from displaying in the Visual Experience Composer if the page contains mixed content (for example, a non-secure page in a secure site). If your page does not display, click the icon to the left of the URL in the browser address bar and click ** `Disable protection on this page` **. This issue does not affect the display of your pages to site visitors. 


On the Preferences tab, you can enter the default URL for the Experience Editor in the Simulator URL field. This URL determines where you start when you open the Experience Editor. if you do not enter a default, then you start with a blank page when you open the editor, and specify a URL at that time.
