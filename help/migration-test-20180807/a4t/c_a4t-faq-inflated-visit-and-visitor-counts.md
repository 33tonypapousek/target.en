# Inflated Visit and Visitor Counts - A4T FAQ


## Why does my Analytics data show visits that have no page views or other variable values? {#section_4D8C2C2D766842E6B12F3ECC774A64D5}

When `Adobe Analytics` is used to measure `Target` activities (called A4T), `Analytics` collects additional data that is not available when there is no `Target` activity on the page. This is because the `Target` activity fires a call at the top of the page, but `Analytics` typically fires its data collection calls at the bottom of the page. In the implementation of A4T to date, we included this additional data whenever a `Target` activity was active. 
For more information, see [Minimizing Inflated Visit and Visitor Counts in A4T](c_a4t_troubleshooting.md#concept_A515C2DE126E44B6AD97754C2C6D5235). 

## What is a partial-data hit? {#section_59A203E289564576BF6821F96B0B9E11}

A partial-data hit occurs when a `Target` tag at the top of the page fires but an `Analytics` tag at the bottom of the page does not fire. There are various reasons why this happens. In the `A4T` implementation to date, we included partial data about these hits whenever a `Target` activity was active. Going forward, we will include this additional data only when both the `Target` and `Analytics` tags have fired. 
For more information, see [Minimizing Inflated Visit and Visitor Counts in A4T](c_a4t_troubleshooting.md#concept_A515C2DE126E44B6AD97754C2C6D5235). 

## I can see a spike in visits. How can I tell if I these were caused by partial-data hits? {#section_28506672C6224ED18AC74F6A02F6F811}

You can contact [Adobe Customer Care](r_release_notes.md#concept_34A1CA16F2244D42930BB77846A5ABBB) to retrieve a Partial Data report. This information is not available directly in the `Analytics` UI. 

## What are the potential causes of partial-data hits? {#section_C4BB9925CE6444BE8CB9FBEFE5085546}

Partial-data hits are often the result from improper implementation, such as misaligned report suite IDs. There are also legitimate causes, which include slow pages, page errors, redirect offers in an activity, or outdated library versions.
For more information, see "What Contributes to Partial Data" in [Minimizing Inflated Visit and Visitor Counts in A4T](c_a4t_troubleshooting.md#concept_A515C2DE126E44B6AD97754C2C6D5235). 

## I have partial-data hits. What can I do to clean up my data? {#section_CBE778A9D07A469E8FF98F68BACC7124}

You can create a virtual report suite to exclude historical partial data from your reports.
For more information, see "How Can I View Historical Trends Without Partial Data?" in [Minimizing Inflated Visit and Visitor Counts in A4T](c_a4t_troubleshooting.md#concept_A515C2DE126E44B6AD97754C2C6D5235). 

## Is there anything I can do to prevent my pages from generating partial-data hits? {#section_4B00E7E618444BE98A0798DE98F08B21}

After November 14, 2016, we will include data only when both the `Target` and `Analytics` tags have fired. This change is not retroactive. If your historical reports show inflated counts, and you would like to exclude them from your reports, you can create a virtual report suite, as explained in "How Can I View Historical Trends Without Partial Data?" in [Minimizing Inflated Visit and Visitor Counts in A4T](c_a4t_troubleshooting.md#concept_A515C2DE126E44B6AD97754C2C6D5235). 
There are also steps you can perform to minimize partial-data hits. For more information, see "What are the Best Practices to Reduce Partial Data?" in [Minimizing Inflated Visit and Visitor Counts in A4T](c_a4t_troubleshooting.md#concept_A515C2DE126E44B6AD97754C2C6D5235). 

## If partial-data-hit data is removed from reporting, arenâ€™t we losing valuable Target or Analytics data? {#section_EBC39E8A0F6A40E58F51E776936F7D9E}

Including partial data in `Analytics` reporting does provide additional information, it also creates inconsistency with historical data from periods when there were no `Target` activities running. This can cause problems for `Analytics` users who are analyzing trends over time.

## Are there any particular types of Target activities that are more likely to cause partial-data hits? {#section_69837442A9B84366BEFDA4588B31E574}

Redirect offers immediately send a user to a different page, which means the `Analytics` call does not fire on the first page. 

>[!NOTE]

>After November 14, 2016, customers will no longer be able to create A4T activities with redirect offers.
