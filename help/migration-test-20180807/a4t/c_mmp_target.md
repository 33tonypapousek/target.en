# Marketing Cloud Audiences and Adobe Target

Analytics can look at an Analytics user, notice a difference in the visitor that might require a new segment or a different action, then share the segment to Target for the delivery of content based on what is known about the visitor. Unlike previous integrations, Target does not create an approximation or a rule with similar information to what is provided by Analytics. Both solutions share and use the same visitor profile.
Marketers benefit by receiving a single marketing view of the customer, enabling the system to deliver personalized experiences based on the profile in real time. This eliminates the problems caused when teams share different numbers and views into a customer's actions. Marketing Cloud Audiences shares the same information across all solutions.
Consumers benefit by receiving a relevant and personalized experience, regardless of the channel used to engage with a brand. Marketing Cloud Audiences provides a better, more personal experience on a site.
Marketing Cloud Audiences replaces the previous Target-to-Analytics integration, which used different data on each side of the integration. Integrating different solutions, each with its own data, resulted in approximations of what each solution provided, but no precise view into a site visitor's profile and segments.
