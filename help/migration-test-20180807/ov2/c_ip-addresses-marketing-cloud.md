# IP Addresses in the Marketing Cloud

Some clients' firewall configurations block IP addresses originating from Adobe's data collection servers or servers responsible for accessing data. The following list of IP address blocks covers the currently known addresses involved in the Adobe Marketing Cloud. You can use this list of ranges to alter your organization's firewall settings to allow log-in access to the `Adobe Marketing Cloud`. You can also use them to send data from within your organization. 
`Target` `Recommendations` activities, for example, use these IP addresses when accessing customers' FTP servers. 
For the complete list of IP addresses, see [IP Addresses used in the Adobe Marketing Cloud](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/adobe-ip-addresses.html).
