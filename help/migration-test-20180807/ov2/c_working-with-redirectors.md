# Working with Redirectors

Redirectors are created with a special Redirector URL that loads a Redirector mbox (Redirector) into your account. Use this Redirector similarly to how you use an mbox in your tests. Submit the Redirector URL to your Ad Network as the ad's destination link.
Use the Redirector to do the following:

* Track clicks from your display ads to your site

* Create a single centralized report to track clicks to display ads on multiple ad networks

* Vary display ad destinations
  For example the same banner lands on your home page, category page and product page.

* Find which landing page leads to the most conversions
