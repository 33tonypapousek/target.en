# Troubleshooting User Management

This section contains the following information:

* [I invited a user to Target, but his or her name does not display in the Users list (Setup &gt; Users).](c_troubleshooting-user-management.md#section_13A1A9697BA44537BA569C81CF136160)


## I invited a user to Target, but his or her name does not display in the Users list (Setup > Users). {#section_13A1A9697BA44537BA569C81CF136160}

You will not see the new user listed on the `Users` page until the user logs in using his or her Adobe Marketing Cloud account and then logs in to `Target Standard/Premium` by clicking the `Target` card.
