# mbox.js Frequently Asked Questions

**Does `at.js` support Safari and cross domain set to x-only?** 
No, if cross domain is set to x-only and Safari has third-party cookies disabled, then both `mbox.js` and `at.js` will set a disabled cookie and no mbox requests will be executed for that particular client's domain.
