# Validate Targeting to New or Returning Visitors


>1. In your browser, delete all mbox cookies.

>       This allows you to appear as a new user (new visitor). 
>1. Browse to the targeted campaign, experience or mbox, or conversion mbox.
>1. Verify you see the expected content for a new user.
>1. Test the expected content (or lack of content ) shows for a returning visitor.

>       Close your browser, and reopen it. Do not delete your mbox cookies. Confirm that as a returning visitor, you see the expected content. 

>       A "returning visitor" is someone who is on the website for at least their second session. 

>       **Tip:** To imitate being a return visitor for testing purposes, there must be at least 30 minutes of inactivity between site views. When a second session has started, a new ` sessionID` appears in the ` mboxDebug` popup utility. 
>1. If segments filters are set, confirm reports correctly capture the parameter values.
