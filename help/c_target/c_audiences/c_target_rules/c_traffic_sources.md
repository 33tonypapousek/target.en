# Traffic Sources

For example, you can target based on the visitor's browser, search engine, or the referring landing page. The referring landing page is the page you clicked from to reach the current site this session. (For example, if you click an ad on Google and it leads you to the ` adobe.com` home page, the referring landing page is ` google.com`.) 

You can combine multiple traffic sources to create a complex targeting rule.
