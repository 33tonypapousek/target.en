## GDPR Overview {#section_8C99434A431B4494998B01B869E7EA5D}

On May 25, 2018, the European Union's GDPR goes into effect. For more information about what this means for you, see [ GDPR and Your Business](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/general-data-protection-regulation.html). 

When Adobe is providing software and services to an enterprise, Adobe is acting as a Data Processor for any personal data it processes and stores as part of providing these services. As a Data Processor, Adobe processes personal data in accordance with your company's permission and instructions (for example, as set out in your agreement with Adobe). 

As the Data Controller, you determine the personal data that Adobe processes and stores on your behalf. If you use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, Adobe might host personal data for you, depending on the solutions you use and the information you choose to send to your Adobe Experience Cloud account. For a detailed list of examples, see [ Adobe Experience Cloud Privacy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html#collect). 

Adobe Experience Cloud will be providing GDPR-ready APIs for Data Controllers that allow them to complete the following tasks, prior to the GDPR regulation's effective date: 


* Access Data Subject information stored within Target 

* Delete Data Subject information stored within Target
