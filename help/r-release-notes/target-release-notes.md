# Target release notes (prerelease){#target-release-notes-prerelease}

This article contains prerelease information. Release dates, features, and other information are subject to change without notice. 

**Last Updated: April 20, 2020**

To view information about the current release, see [Target Release Notes](release-notes.md). The information on these pages might be the same, depending on the timing of releases. The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal [!DNL Adobe] use.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* **mbox.js deprecation**: On August 30, 2020, Adobe Target will no longer support the mbox.js library. Post August 30, 2020, all calls made from mbox.js will fail and impact your pages that have Target activities running. We recommend that all customers migrate to the most recent version of the at.js library before this date to avoid any potential issues with your sites. For more information, see [How At.js Works](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/c-how-atjs-works/how-atjs-works.md). See *Adobe Target Skill Builder: Developer chat, migrate Adobe Target's mbox.js to at.js* below for information about registering for an upcoming developer chat about this subject.
>
>   Although, mbox.js is currently supported, we have not provided feature updates to this library since July 2017. The newer at.js provides many advantages over mbox.js. Among other benefits, at.js improves page load times for web implementations, improves security, and provides better implementation options for single page applications.
>
>   By moving all customers to at.js, our engineers and support staff will be able to provide you with new functionality and offer the support you have come to expect from Adobe.
