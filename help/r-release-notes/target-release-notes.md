>These release notes contain prerelease information. Release dates, features, and other information are subject to change.

## Announcements

Be aware of the following important announcements:

* [!DNL Target] and the [!DNL Adobe Marketing Cloud] will drop support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 starting in March 2019. This change affects [!DNL Target] authoring only; this change does not affect experience delivery. Please switch to Microsoft Edge or another browser. For more information, see [Supported browsers](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/supported-browsers.md).
* Starting with the [!DNL Target] 18.4.1 release (April 25, 2018), [!DNL Target] had taken steps to move towards TLS 1.2 encryption. The final date to completely phase out support for TLS 1.0 encryption is **February 20, 2019**. With this change, [!DNL Adobe] will no longer collect data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. We do not expect this to have a significant impact to customer data or reporting. Migrating to TLS 1.2 provides improved security. It is important that you go through the specifics and plan out the changes for a smooth transition. For more information, see [TLS (Transport Layer Security) Encryption Changes](../c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/tls-transport-layer-security-encryption.md).
