## Target Standard/Premium 19.10.1 (October 22, 2019)

|Feature / Enhancement|Description|
| --- | --- |
|![Premium badge](/help/assets/premium.png) User-Based Recommendations|Recommends items based off of each visitor's browsing, viewing, and purchasing history. These items are generally referred to as "Recommended for You."<br>This criteria lets you deliver personalized content and experiences to both new and returning visitors. The list of recommendations is weighted towards the visitor's most-recent activity and is updated in-session and becomes more personalized as the visitor browses your site.|

### Enhancements, fixes, and changes

* When you log in to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], you will be taken to the new header navigation. It looks very similar to the previous navigation with the black bar at the top, but it provides the following improvements:

  * Easier switching between [!DNL Identity Management System] (IMS) organizations or to a different solution.
  * Improved user help: Search results include results from the [!DNL Target] product documentation, as well as community forums and more video content, giving you easier access to more content to help get the most out [!DNL Target]. We’ve also added a feedback mechanism right in the [!UICONTROL Help] menu, making it easier to report issues or to share your ideas.

  * Improved Net Promoter Score (NPS) feedback functionality, so the survey modal doesn’t disturb your flow of work.
  * Improved log-in flow. Previously, all [!DNL Target] customers landed on the Target landing page after clicking the [!DNL Target] icon in the header. This page then allowed customers to proceed forward with [!DNL Target Standard/Premium], [!DNL Search&Promote], or [!DNl Recommendations Classic],  as shown below:

    ![Landing page](/help/r-release-notes/assets/landing.png)
  
    We eliminated this landing page for all our customers. You are now always taken directly to the [!UICONTROL Activities List] page by clicking the [!DNL Target] icon in the new header navigation bar. 
    
    If you use [!DNL Recommendations Classic], you can either go directly to the solution or you can go from the short link created on the [!UICONTROL Recommendations] tab, as shown below:

    ![Recs Classic deep link](/help/r-release-notes/assets/recs-classic.png)
    
    If you use [!DNL Search&Promote], you need to go directly to the link. The path to reach [!DNL Search&Promote] from inside of [!DNL Adobe Target] has been removed completely.
    
  * Notifications for [!DNL Target] are not currently available in the [!UICONTROL Notifications] drop-down in the header.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >These features will not be rolled out at once, nor will they be rolled out to all customers together. We will be rolling out these features over the course of next few days starting the [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] 19.10.1 (October 22, 2019) release.
  >
  >As part of the rollout of the new navigation bar, you will also notice some URL changes. All previous bookmarked links continue to work but we encourage you to bookmark new links for faster opening.
