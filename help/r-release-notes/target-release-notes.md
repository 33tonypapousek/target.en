## Announcements

Be aware of the following important announcements:

* On February 20, 2019, the Adobe Target infrastructure was upgraded in the EMEA, Japan, and APAC regions to no longer collect data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. This same upgrade is planned for the North America region for **April 1, 2019**. Migrating to TLS 1.2 provides improved security. It is important that you go through the specifics and plan out the changes with your IT team for a smooth transition. For more information, see [TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption changes](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/tls-transport-layer-security-encryption.md).
* [!DNL Target] and the [!DNL Adobe Marketing Cloud] will drop support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 starting in March 2019. This change affects [!DNL Target] authoring only; this change does not affect experience delivery. Please switch to Microsoft Edge or another browser. For more information, see [Supported browsers](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/supported-browsers.md).


## [!DNL Target] Standard/Premium 19.5.1 (May 21, 2019) {#release-19-5-1-prerelease}

This release includes the following features, changes, and enhancements:

(The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal [!DNL Adobe] use.)

|Feature / Enhancement | Description |
| --- | --- |
|Visual Experience Composer (VEC)| |
|Single Page App Visual Experience Composer (SPA VEC)||
|Assets|You can now list and navigate more easily through offer folders in the Asset picker instead of navigating through a flat folder hierarchy. (TGT-33725)|
|![Premium badge](/help/assets/premium.png)<br>Automated Personalization (AP) & Auto-Target activities|You can select an experience to be used as control while creating an AP or Auto-Target activity. This feauture lets you route the entire control traffic to a specific experience, based on the traffic allocation percentage configured in the activity. You can then evaluate the performance of the personalized servings against the control experience.(TGT-26572)|
|![Premium badge](/help/assets/premium.png)<br>Recommendations|You can use the Recommend Previously Purchased Items toggle while creating Recently Viewed Items logic. (TGT-34030)|


**Enhancement, fixes, and changes**

* We improved the workflow when you delete assets using the VEC. Deleted assets are now removed from the [!UICONTROL Offers library] and from [!DNL Scene7] (if applicable). Deleted assets no longer display in search results. (TGT-31981)
* You can now delete asset folders even if they contain images (non-empty folders). (TGT-33265)

  Previously, you could not delete a non-empty folder from the Target image offers library ([!UICONTROL Offers] > [!UICONTROL Image Offers]). You would get a â€œFolder is not empty!" notification when trying to delete the folder from the UI.  With this feature, we are adding the capability to let you perform the folder deletion to remove an entire folder containing any number of assets and sub-folders inside. This feature is available in the Target UI as well in the Adobe Experience Cloud Assets UI.

  Consider the following:

  * When deleting a folder, some stale references can take time to delete from the database. You might see some folders displayed in the UI that take several minutes to delete (approximately 10 minutes for 2,000 assets). The deletion process is being performed behind the scenes. Check back later to verify the deletion.
  * If the request takes too long, it might get timed out in the browser. This can lead to showing an error notification in the UI. For now, ignore the error message and visit the asset folder after a while (same as above).
  * If there are blank folders remaining that contain assets, try deleting the folder again after a while (same as above).

* We improved the rendering of image offers in the Assets picker. Displaying and selecting image offers is now quicker and more efficient. (TGT-32897)
* We improved the handling of redirects to URLs when you cancel loading of a page within the VEC. (TGT-33815)
* After you select a [!UICONTROL Recommendations] collection from the Collections picker, you must now click the [!UICONTROL Save] button. This workflow is consistent with other workflows within [!DNL Target]. (TGT-33205)
* Fixed an issue that caused a small set of Insights reports to return 0% conversion rates instead of the actual conversion rates. (TNT-32125)
