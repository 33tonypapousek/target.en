## Adobe Target Community Q&A Coffee Break

**Wednesday, June 10, 2020** 

**10:00 to 11:00 a.m. (PST)**

Please join us for our upcoming [!DNL Adobe Target] Community Q&A Coffee Break! This is part of a series we’ve recently kicked off for our internal experts to engage directly with you on our forum threads for a “Coffee Break.” Think of it as the [!DNL Adobe Target] Community forum equivalent of an AMA (Ask Me Anything) or a twitter-chat.

David Son, [!DNL Target] Product Manager, will be answering all of your questions. David's area of expertise include:

* at.js
* Mobile
* Alloy
* APIs

But feel free to ask any Target-related questions.

You simply need to be signed in to the [Adobe Target Community](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-target/ct-p/adobe-target-community) in order to participate.
