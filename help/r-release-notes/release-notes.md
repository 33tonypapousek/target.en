# Target release notes (current){#target-release-notes-current}

These release notes provide information about features, enhancements, and fixes for each Target Standard and Target Premium release.

## Announcements

Be aware of the following important announcements:

* On February 20, 2019, the Adobe Target infrastructure was upgraded in the EMEA, Japan, and APAC regions to no longer collect data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. This same upgrade is planned for the North America region for **April 1, 2019**. Migrating to TLS 1.2 provides improved security. It is important that you go through the specifics and plan out the changes with your IT team for a smooth transition. For more information, see [TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption changes](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/tls-transport-layer-security-encryption.md).
* [!DNL Target] and the [!DNL Adobe Marketing Cloud] will drop support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 starting in March 2019. This change affects [!DNL Target] authoring only; this change does not affect experience delivery. Please switch to Microsoft Edge or another browser. For more information, see [Supported browsers](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/supported-browsers.md).

## Target Standard/Premium 19.7.1 (July 24, 2019) {#tgt-19-7-1}

This release includes the following new features and enhancements:

(The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use.)

|Feature / Enhancement|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Mobile App Visual Experience Composer|A new Modifications panel displays in the Mobile App VEC that displays the elements you have set up for click-tracking. (TGT-31741)<br> See [Set up click tracking in the Mobile App](/help/c-target-mobile-app/c-mobile-visual-experience-composer/set-up-click-tracking-in-the-mobile-vec.md).|
|![Premium badge](/help/assets/premium.png)<br>Recommendations in A/B Test and Experience Targeting (XT) activities|The Recommendations offer (algorithm) status displays on the Overview page for A/B Test and XT activities that contain Recommendations offers. Statuses include: Results Ready, Results Not Ready, and Feed Failure. (TGT-33649)<br>See [Recommendations as an offer](/help/c-recommendations/recommendations-as-an-offer.md#status).|
|Cross-domain tracking support for at.js 2.0+ via the Experience Cloud ID  (ECID) library|Previously, cross-domain tracking was not supported in at.js 2.*x*. With this release, customers using at.js 2.0 or above can now utilize cross-domain tracking through the ECID library. The ECID library must be installed on the page in conjunction with at.js 2.0 or above in order for cross-domain tracking to work. [Experience Cloud ID library 4.3.0+](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-release-notes.html) must be used.<br>See [Cross-domain tracking support in at.js 2.x](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/upgrading-from-atjs-1x-to-atjs-20.md#cross-domain).|
|Target support for Apple’s ITP 2.1 and ITP 2.2 via the Experience Cloud ID (ECID) library 4.3|Today, Target customers can mitigate Apple's ITP 2.1 and ITP 2.2 by leveraging Adobe’s CNAME certification program.<br>With this release, Target introduces a seamless integration with the ECID library 4.3, which leverages a server-side cookie to mitigate ITP 2.1 and ITP 2.2. It is highly recommended that Target customers deploy [ECID library 4.3+](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-release-notes.html) in conjunction with Target’s JavaScript library to mitigate any future ITP releases. The ECID library will continue to roll out enhancements that provide a robust solution to the ever-changing cookie policies introduced by browsers.<br>See [Apple Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) 2.x](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/c-privacy/apple-itp-2x.md).|

**Enhancement, fixes, and changes**

* Fixed an issue that prevented exclusion values in Recommendations activities from being cleared when adding duplicate values. (TGT-34996)
* You can now remove a design in a Recommendations activity from the Targeting page (Step 2 of the three-part guided workflow). Note that to remove a design, there must be more than one design selected. (TGT-35118)
* Fixed an issue that prevented custom criteria cards for some customers to load properly in the Target UI or to be editable. (TGT-35170)

## at.js version 2.1.1 (July 24, 2019)

This release of at.js is a maintenance release and includes the following enhancements and fixes:

(The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use.)

* Fixed an issue that caused multiple beacons to fire when using the Click Tracking metric on the Goals & Settings page in the Visual Experience Composer (VEC). (TNT-32812)
* Fixed an issue that caused `triggerView()` to not render offers more than once. (TNT-32780)
* Fixed an issue with `triggerView()` to ensure that the request contains Marketing Cloud ID (MCID) information. (TNT-32776)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the `triggerView()` notification to fire even if there are no saved views. (TNT-32614)
* Fixed an issue that caused an error due to the use of decodeURIcomponent that caused issues when the URL contains a malformed query string parameter. (TNT-32710)
* The beacon flag is now set to "true" in the context of delivery requests sent via the `Navigator.sendBeacon()` API. (TNT-32683)
* Fixed an issue that prevented Recommendations offers from displaying on websites for a few customers. Customers could see the offer content in the delivery API call but the offer was not applied on the website. (TNT-32680)
* Fixed an issue that caused click-tracking across multiple experiences to not work as expected. (TNT-32644)
* Fixed an issue that prevented at.js from applying the second metric after the rendering of the first metric fails. (TNT-32628)
* Fixed an issue when passing `mboxThirdPartyId` using the `targetPageParams` function that caused the request payload to not be present in either the query parameters or in the request payload. (TNT-32613)
* Fixed an issue that caused display and click notification responses to be blocked in Chromium-based browsers (including Google Chrome). (TNT-32290)
