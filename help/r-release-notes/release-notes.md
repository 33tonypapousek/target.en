# Target release notes (current){#target-release-notes-current}

These release notes provide information about features, enhancements, and fixes for each Target Standard and Target Premium release. In addition, release notes for Target APIs, SDKs, the JavaScript library (at.js), and other platform changes are also included, when applicable.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Starting on March 1, 2020, Target will disable support for TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0 encryption. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most-widely deployed security protocol used today for web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network. This change is needed to meet the generally accepted security compliance standard of TLS 1.2 or higher. Check which TLS version you are currently using. If your version is lower than 1.2, implement the required changes prior to March 1, 2020 in order to continue to use Target as expected.
>
> For detailed information on the possible impact and the steps you might need to take to update your implementation, see [TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption changes](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/tls-transport-layer-security-encryption.md).

The issue numbers in parentheses are for internal [!DNL Adobe] use.
